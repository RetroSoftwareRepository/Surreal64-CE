Info

South Park Rally is a kart-style racing video game, based on the American animated comedy series South Park. Developed by Tantalus and published by Acclaim in 2000 - near the end of the third season of the show - for PlayStation, Windows (PC), Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast systems, the game includes many characters, vehicles, locations, items and other features inspired by or featured on the series. Development work on the title - based on Tantalus' own concept - was done on three platforms simultaneously, and took seven months.

South Park Rally was the third video game based on the series. Previously Acclaim has also published the games South Park (1998) and Chef's Luv Shack (1999). South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had little to do with the development of South Park Rally (as well as the two other Acclaim releases), although they did contribute a number of original lines of voice acting for it, as they do most of the voices on the show. Parker and Stone have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the games.South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! was released in 2009, nine years after Rally, by a different publisher.
