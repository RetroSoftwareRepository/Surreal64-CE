Gameplay

The main objective is to play in tournaments through each circuit and defeat Cyber Tiger and other golfers to win the championship as a professional in career mode. This is the first game to feature Tiger Woods as a character in video game other than Tiger Woods PGA Tour.

Playing as either Tiger Woods or one of your own creations, you get to play on Spyglass Hill, the featured golf course in the game. After winning in the Career mode you can unlock the other championship courses. The Career mode allows you to start out as a kid and earn your way to being an adult. You start off on the Junior Tour as a young golfer playing in a one-round tournament. After that you compete in three more tournaments. Winning any one of them allows you to go to the Amateur Tour where you must win one of two events to qualify for the Pro Tour. After that you can start earning cash.

CyberTiger includes Power-Up Balls which allow you to save yourself in desperate times or to give you an edge. Balls include "superballs" that bounce on any terrain, and eyeballs that go straight during their flight. Other options include SuperDrive, hidden tricks, hidden golfers and power-ups. The game also introduces: Tiger Control, which allows you to put spin (topspin and backspin) on the ball while it's in flight; real-time analog swing and ball control; and the ability to fade or draw.

CyberTiger supports vibration feedback devices as well as analog control. In addition, two blocks of memory are required for saving and a Multi Tap compatible adapter is needed for a game that's up to four players.
