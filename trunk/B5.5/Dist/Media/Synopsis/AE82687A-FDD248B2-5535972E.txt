Gameplay

The game featured all the tracks from that Formula One season, at a time when the racing began in Australia, and ended in Japan. Teams would be set up with relevant drivers, however there was a roster-feature included, which allowed the player to swap drivers from one team to another, and even removing a real driver and replacing him with unknown drivers named Driver 1-6.

Grand Prix Mode allowed players to progress through the racing calendar, you could also choose single races or a time trial on various tracks. Battle mode allowed you to pick who you wanted to race against over a however many laps you chose. This added challenges to see if you could go from the back of the grid to 1st over one lap of Interlagos, Brazil. The game lacked destructible vehicles, and allowed players to only drive a maximum of 10 laps on every track, rendering the game quite unrealistic compared to other F1 games on the N64 such as F-1 World Grand Prix, released in 1998, and F-1 World Grand Prix II, released in 2000. The game also featured primitive graphics, almost reminiscent of the 16-bit Super Nintendo. For some reason, Rubens Barrichello's helmet is the only one rendered correctly out of all the drivers.
