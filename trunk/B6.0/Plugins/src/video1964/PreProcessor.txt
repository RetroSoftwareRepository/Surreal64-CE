1964video preprocessor definitions descriptions

--FRAMEBUFFER CHANGES--
_DISABLE_VID1964
 - Disables framebuffer changes made to 1964video, uses Rice 5.60 behavior
_RICE6FB
 - Enables FB code used in Rice 6, code is nearly identical to 1964video's, only with a good refactor
Undefined behavior uses 1964video 1.0.0

--CLIPPER CHANGES--
_DISABLE_CLIP_FAR
 - Rice 6 disables far plane clipping. Is this because of the new vertex clipper?
_OLDCLIPPER
 - Forces clipping code used in Rice 5.60
Undefined behavior uses 1964video 1.0.0. Rice 6.12 clipper relie's on software vertex clipping that is unsupported on Xbox.

--TILE CHANGES--
_VID1964_TILE
 - Sets stricter conditions for faster loading tiles. Fixes issues with spinning WWF logo in  WWF No Mercy 
_RICE612_TILE -OR- _RICE560_TILE
 - Uses Tile validification in Rice 5.60 and anything newer than Rice 6.11
Undefined behavior uses tile validification in 1964video 1.0.0. Different from _VID1964_TILE
_VID1964_FIX
 - Fixes tiles in TGO splash screens

--PRIMITIVECOLOR RELATED CHANGES--
_RICE612_PRIMCOLOR
 - Disables usage of gRDP.primitiveColor in Render.cpp
_RICE612_FILL
 - Disables usage of gRDP.primitiveColor in RSP_Parser.cpp by forcing a condition that usually checks if cycle_type is fill mode
These defines may eliminate code used by video cards older than the Xbox

--CLAMPING CHANGES--
_RICE560_CLAMP
 - Uses clamping code from Rice 5.60
_RICE612_CLAMP
 - Uses clamping code from Rice 6.12 XBOX
Undefined behavior uses clamping from 1964video 1.0.0

--CRC CALC CHANGES--
_RICE612_CRC
 - Uses PAL texture CRC calculation from Rice 6
Undefined uses behavior in 1964video 1.0.0 and earlier

--HACKS--
_RICE612_TEXTEDGE
 - Uses Text Edge hack from Rice 6, I don't see where this helps. Usually looks worse? Doom64
_RICE612_HACK
 - Forces a smaller block of code to be used for games other than Yoshi Story. Code handles calls to DrawSimple2DTexture. Need to find out if there are regressions before using this.
_RICE612_ALPHACOMP
 - Added alpha compares after 1964video 1.0.0. Not sure what this fixes.
_RICE612_FIX
 - Moves some texture width checks to be done if the texture exists. looks good.
_RICE612_DKR
 - Changes Matrix declaration for DKR so it works with 1964video. Not sure why this needs to be done.
_XBOX_HACK
 - Limits Combiner Stages to 4, and avoids creating large textures
_XBOX_HACK2
 -Checks format for rendertarget
