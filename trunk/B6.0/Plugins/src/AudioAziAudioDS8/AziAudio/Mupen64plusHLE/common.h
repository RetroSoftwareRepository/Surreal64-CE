 * `bool' is not C programming, even if C99 granted the request.
 * Relevant C interpretation of Booleans is:  zero and nonzero.

 * Past that, issues like allocation, packing or padding with Booleans are
 * more than controllable in correct C with or without type definitions,
 * especially in modern optimizing compilers.  The remaining issue is the
 * ability to say "true" and "false"--again external features irrelevant to
 * completeness of C implementation for the specific hardware architecture.
