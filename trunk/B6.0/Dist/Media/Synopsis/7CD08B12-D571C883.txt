The game player starts out as Elwood in prison who needs to get the band together for the battle of the bands, which is in less than two days. After saving the guitarist, Cab, then defeating the warden, the player progresses through Chicago, in hopes of finding Mac and Buster. After going about the rooftops, the player enters Willie's Club, where Mac is being held captive. After defeating Willie, Mac says that Buster has escaped to the old graveyard. Arriving there, the player finds that an evil tree has put Buster in a cage. The final battle takes place in a swamp.
