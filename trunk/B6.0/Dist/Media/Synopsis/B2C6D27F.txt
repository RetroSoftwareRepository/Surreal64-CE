Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku (? lit. "Goemon Sugoroku of Mononoke?) is a video game for the Nintendo 64, released in 1999. The game is based on the Ganbare Goemon series and despite the series' relative popularity in the west for the system, the game was released only in Japan.

The game itself copies off the Japanese board game Sugoroku, populated with Konami's array of Ganbare Goemon characters. Up to four players control two dice, and take it in turns to control Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae over prerendered boards that resemble previous locations in the Ganbare Goemon series.

Features Yae's new outfit that would be used in subsequent titles.
