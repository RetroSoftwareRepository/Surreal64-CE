Description

You're taking a Tahoe 155 snowboard down a steep, bumpy incline at night and you're about to top off an Indy Nosebone with a 360 Air, and you haven't even left your living room! You're playing 1080 (Ten Eighty) Snowboarding, a game so intense you'll be brushing the snow off your goggles. With five different boarders, eight different Lamar snowboards, more than 25 tricks, a Half-Pipe and six different courses, this is as close as you'll get to the real thing without hopping on the next ski lift.

Gameplay

The player controls a snowboarder in one of six modes. 1080° has two trick modes (trick attack and contest),[7] three race modes (race, time attack, and multiplayer), a training mode, and an options mode.[9] The objective of the game is either to arrive quickly at a level's finish line or to receive maximum points for trick combinations.

Trick modes

In 1080°'s two trick modes, trick attack and contest, players accrue points from completed tricks.[10] In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players to perform a series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 25 tricks, all of which are performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity and required time.[10] The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees.[11] The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.

Race modes

1080° has three race modes; in these modes, victory can be achieved by taking separate routes within a course and balancing the snowboarder after a jump to avoid speed loss.[13] Tricks are scored in race modes, but do not count toward victory.

In match race mode, the player competes in a series of races against AI-controlled snowboarders.[14] The game times the player throughout the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.

Characters

Players may initially choose from five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, USA, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, since each has varying statistics in fields such as technique, speed, and weight. Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes. Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in different situations, since each have different strengths in categories such as balance and edge control

40 Winks is a platform video game published in 1999 by Eurocom Entertainment Software and GT Interactive Software for the PlayStation video game console. The game is now avaliable on the Playstation Network.
[edit] Gameplay

The player takes control of either Ruff or Tumble, a brother and sister who are sleeping and trying to free 40 "Winks" from a man named Nitekap and his accomplice, Threadbear. In the game's plot, "Winks" are small, white creatures which make dreams, and "Hoodwinks", which are green and of a similar size are what are responsible for nightmares.

Throughout the game, the player can collect moon-shaped tokens, which are used to scream at dreamy apparitions, and Z-shaped tokens, which stop the player's character from waking up. Floating cogs are also collected to open doors. The character travels through dream worlds, such as haunted houses, ship wrecks, planets and prehistoric lands. The player can also transform into various types of beings.

N64 Fail-

A nearly-complete version was developed for the Nintendo 64, and even reviewed in Nintendo Official Magazine, but was cancelled due to the Nintendo 64's declining sales.[1] Ironically, print advertisements for the PlayStation version of the game came with a review quote stating "Move over, Mario...", supposedly from Nintendo Official Magazine.

Gameplay

A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.

Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.

Several bosses are encountered during the game:

    Thumper
    The Bird
    Thud
    Molt
    Hopper

Description

The AeroFighters Assault team needs your help to save the Earth from the evil Phutta Morgana and their machines of doom. Engage a variety of enemy aircraft and boss characters around the globe in multiple missions. Join the battle in the only game that matters!

Info

Aero Fighters Assault, known in Japan as Sonic Wings Assault (????????? ?????), is a fighting airplane shooter for the Nintendo 64, released in November 1997. It pits a group of four pilots going after a fictional world-dominating organization Phutta Morgana. It is the sixth and last game in the Aero Fighters series (known as Sonic Wings in Japan) before Video System filed for bankruptcy and defunct.

The game is arcade style, meaning that the object is to go through the entire game and score as many points as possible. Points are awarded for having all wingmen survive, how many defensive countermeasures and special weapons the player has remaining, and how many hits the plane has remaining when the stage ends. In many cases, earning high point values yields unlocking a bonus mission during gameplay, with a total of 4 bonus missions in all.

There are 4 aircraft to choose from at the beginning, each with a different special weapon and missile type. Two more aircraft can be unlocked; one via push-button code, and the other by successfully completing all of the missions in the game including the bonus missions.

Aero Fighters Assault contains a two-player deathmatch option in which two players face off against each other. Additional planes can also be unlocked for the multiplayer mode based on progress in the single player campaign.

The aircraft paint scheme for the four main characters is changeable by pushing the R-button in the selection screen.

Description

Blaze through the skies as you take control of your very own Aeromachines in this new futuristic racing game, AeroGauge. With courses that have sharp turns, and even sharper obstacles, it is going to take a keen eye and ultimate control to maneuver through courses featuring canyons, tunnels, oceans, and mountains. Imagine speeds reaching over 1000 mph as you whiz by the field in route to victory in these graphically advanced landscapes. Never has a game incorporated such remarkable control, detailed graphics, and mind-tingling speeds as...AeroGauge!


AeroGauge is a futuristic hovercraft racing game for the Nintendo 64 released in 1998 (1997 in Japan).

Ascii's AeroGauge runs basically along the same conceptual lines of play as Psygnosis' Wipeout or Acclaim's Extreme G. The main difference is that the vehicles in the game fly instead of staying a few meters over the track, so it's possible to maneuver them in the air (unlike the previously mentioned games).

Description

Young Alaron is on a quest to discover the truth about himself, his name, and his heritage. Traveling to far and distant lands, pursued by forces he cannot understand, danger lurks around every corner. Alaron and his companions will seek to fulfill his destiny as the greatest mage ever known!


Story

Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage follows a young squire named Alaron who, while searching for a missing farmer named Kendall, encounters a strange spirit and is poisoned by Goblins. He awakes from a terrifying vision of monsters to find himself inside the hut of Oriana, a healer, who tells Alaron that the poison is beyond the powers of normal medicine to cure. Upon returning to Castle Gwernia, the king, Phelan, instructs him to ask the Mirari people of Erromon to help heal his poison. Upon reaching Erromon, the Mirari King, Txomin, explains that they've been under attack from goblins and seeks Alaron's aid, promising to direct him to a naming wizard named Cradawgh.

Alaron clears the goblins off the mountains, however when he returns to Erromon he discovers that Txomin lied, and does not know the whereabouts of Cradawgh, telling Alaron instead to travel to Talewok, and see the sorceress, Ardra. Before leaving, Alaron converses with the Mirari queen Yeraza, who gives him the Stormbreaker, a blessed tree branch able to calm any storm.

At the Wizard School, the doorman asks everyone's True Name, but Alaron cannot answer. Ardra the sorceress begins the healing spell, which brings on another vision. This one includes a feeble, old man in a rocking chair. Ardra explains that the healing spell failed because Alaron is a Wildling - he has no True Name. Without a True Name, his spirit is not bound to his body, and Alaron is incomplete. Ardra tells him to travel to Port Saiid and take a boat to Cradawgh's Island.

Alaron is eventually able to hire a boat at Port Saiid - after an unusual encounter with a cryptic jester - but the ship travels into a powerful storm, and as the Stormbreaker is tied to the mast instead of the helm, the ship is damaged and forced to land at Chaos Isle. Following repairs the party sets off for Cradawgh's Island; this time the ship arrives safely, however a group of monsters has already reached Cradawgh. The dying wizard asks Alaron to bring his body to Talewok, and suggests seeking the Jundar King Zaratas in the desert.

After Cradawgh's funeral in Talewok, Alaron heads down to the city of Terminor. He then soon discovers that the nearby village of Pome was destroyed by a wizard with a twisted staff. The final level of Terminor has a house, in which resides Mago, a wizard without a True Name, who went insane several years ago and called up a huge storm when the townspeople tried to kill him. Mago is the feeble, old man from Alaron's earlier vision and can no longer speak.

Alaron travels to a nearby bog, where he finds the Tower of Shamsuk, a powerful necromancer who had previously destroyed Pome and cursed Niesen, slowly turning him into a zombie. Niesen gets the party into the tower where they eventually reach a chamber with a large stone hand. The jester from Port Saiid appears once more, revealing himself to be Farris - a wizard. Farris joins the party, assisting them in defeating Shamsuk, who has already killed Oriana - now revealed to be Alaron's mother. Farris then leaves the party, taking Shamsuk's necromantic staff with him.

Alaron crosses a desert to reach the Jundar city of Ugarit, where he speaks with the Jundar Emperor, Zaratas, who explains that only the dragon Rooughah can name Alaron. He needs to find the Golden Horn of Kynon and play it for Rooughah. Alaron retrieves the Horn, and begins heading back to Erromon.

Alaron travels through the Erromon tunnels until he comes across the dragon Rooughah. After Alaron plays the Horn of Kynon, Rooughah tells him he knows his True Name: "Alaron". The Mirari then tell Alaron that the forces of Chaos are gathering outside Gwernia. Alaron returns to Gwernia castle and fights his way to Prince Sheridan, who confesses to always being jealous of Alaron. Sheridan explains that Alaron is the son of Oriana and King Phelan. Alaron fights and kills Sheridan, only to then meet Pochangarat (the leader of Chaos) - the huge monster from Alaron's first vision in Oriana's hut.

After Pochangarat's death, Alaron finds his father, King Phelan, who is dying from the wounds he suffered at Pochangarat's hands. He requests to be buried under the Great Wall of Knights in Gwernia, and appoints Alaron as his successor before dying. The story ends with Alaron's coronation ceremony.


Playable Characters

Alaron - A headstrong young squire whose eagerness to prove himself often conflicts with his inexperience. Alaron is the product of the King of Gwernia and his true love that now lives in a hut in the forest outside the castle. Alaron can be trained to be any type of character. In the process of Alaron gaining his "true name" he masters all magics in the game and gains some powerful spells.

Brenna - Brenna and Alaron are the best of friends. Brenna was also orphaned while very young before being taken in by the King. She feels that she doesn't get enough respect in Gwernia and wants to find her place in the world as badly as Alaron does. Brenna is a thief, and is good at picking locks, disarming trap and using thrown weapons in addition to being able to learn elemental magic.

Abrecan - Captain of the Gwernian knights, Abrecan's prowess in battle is matched only by his surliness in social situations. As a knight, Abrecan is an exceptional fighter, and due to his high hit point range is the ideal "tank" character. He can be at the front of any combat, holding enemies back from the other characters.

Rheda - High-strung and as demanding of others as she is of herself, Rheda is the apprentice of the wizard Bowden. Skilled in the magic arts, Rheda is an initially weak wizard who can become a powerful and valuable member of the party, working best in a support role. She can use Naming magic and Pole weapons.

Godric - He lives in the basement of Castle Gwernia. Godric's remarks are often too insightful for his medieval friends to comprehend their potential significance, and too absent-minded to put them to much use. He has a talent for alchemy, uses elemental magic, but has little in the way of combat skills.

Becan - A former Gwernian knight, Becan left Gwernia and the king's service after the Goblin raids of Alaron's early childhood. Alaron can find Becan in peddling wares in the Mirari village of Erromon. Becan's fighting skills are comparable to Abrecan; a solid warrior both offensively and defensively.

Arturo - Arturo is the quintessential big dumb fighter. His father was a Gwernian knight, but the closest Arturo ever got to meeting him was receiving his armor after he died. The party meets him while he's "guarding" the bridge to Port Saiid, not letting even legitimate travelers and merchandise pass. Arturo is highly competent in fighting however, and can dish out a great deal of damage and absorb a lot of punishment.

Keelin - The daughter of well-to-do traders in Talewok, Keelin turned to a life of mischief when she was quite young, and has only gotten worse as she's grown. Keelin is Brenna's rival in every way. By the time Alaron meets Keelin, Brenna has started hinting that she's a little jealous of the female attention he's been getting, and Keelin gives Alaron a lot of attention. She's also a very talented thief and is skilled in missile weapons.

Niesen- A powerful wizard who has been poisoned by a great necromancer. This necromancer also killed Niesen's entire family. Wanting revenge, Niesen forces Alaron to go to Shamsuk's tower. Niesen is incredibly weak physically, but is able to use powerful magic.

Farris- A jester obsessed with confusing riddles. He was once a great wizard, though he cast a stupidity spell upon himself. He seems to live life by a single lesson, look out for your own hide. Due to the stupidity spell, Farris cannot use magic. He is, however, quick and packs a decent punch. After the tower is completed, Farris leaves the party. He is skilled at thievery, among many other things.

Donovan - Donovan thinks very highly of himself; so highly, in fact, that he has grown tired of giving fencing lessons to the children of aristocrats in Terminor, and longs for adventure. His prose (and armor) lean towards the melodramatic, but his skills as a warrior and a wizard compensate.

Baird - Baird's sheer size could give Arturo's bulk a run for its money, but, unlike Arturo, Baird has something between his ears. He is an able warrior, and he fancies himself a poet and will regale the group with tales of their legendary quest at every opportunity. Baird is also a talented loremaster and troubador.

Sholeh - A Jundar woman living in the desert near Ugarit, Sholeh is one of the few of her kind who does not display the customary Jundar dislike and distrust of humans. She discovered the blind Wizard Fyrsil in the desert after he failed to stop Mago's magic storm, and she has cared for him ever since. Sholeh is a strong warrior, deadly with missile weapons, and also knows star magic.

Dougal - Dougal is one of the last playable characters the party encounters, and one of the most well-rounded. He's an accomplished warrior and troubador, with strong thief skills and some powerful magic to boot. If he is in the party when Alaron reaches Rooughah's Lair in Erromon, Dougal reveals himself as a traitor to the group and a servant of Rabisat and Chaos. He threatens to steal the Horn of Kynon and fights the party for it.

Reception

Aidyn received either panned or mixed critical reviews. Many of the more positive reviews, such as Nintendo Power, cited its creative storyline (head writer: Angela Ferraiolo) and strategic combat system. Negative reviews generally complained about its outdated graphics, repetitive musical score, and lack of environment details (IGN/4.2).

With All-Star Baseball '99, development house Iguana (Turok, NFL Quarterback Club '98) extends its sterling rep for putting great graphics on the N64. The high-resolution visual feast includes multiple player shadows during night games, digitized photos of most players and extremely detailed texture maps -- just check out the ivy and row houses at Wrigley! In stadiums with Jumbotrons, the action on the big screen replicates that on the field. The athletes are fully articulated, with nice use of shading that gives them a fully rounded look. Batters are graded on multiple characteristics, including whether they are pull, straightaway or opposite-field (push) hitters. Iguana has stacked the lineup with signature stances for everyone from Roberto Alomar to Sammy Sosa.

This is the sequel to Sarge's Heroes. It introduces several new characters, and the concept of "Plastrification". Plastrification, according to Dr. Madd, is a condition that occurs when a soldier from the "Plastic World" spends too much time in the "Real World" causing the hardening of the limbs and the forming of a plastic base. However, the character Bridgette Bleu has developed a serum that reverses the effects of plastrification.

Description

Lay rubber through spectacular landscapes with Titus's Automobili Lamborghini! Six first-class circuits wind though mountains, past waterfalls and under ancient ruins. Great graphics effects, including light flares on your windshield, will take your breath away. But it's the goods under the hood that will have speed freaks salivating.


Gameplay

There are 4 modes of play: Championship, Single Race, Arcade and Time Trial. In a race, if the players' cars run out of fuel or have their tires worn down, they are urged to take a pit stop where they engage in a brief minigame. Automobili Lamborghini featured eight cars that resembled actual supercars. These resembled cars such as the Porsche 959, Ferrari F50, Ferrari Testarossa, Dodge Viper, the McLaren F1, and the Bugatti EB110, that could be unlocked by winning championships. These were joined by the two default cars, which resembled the Lamborghini Countach and Lamborghini Diablo. In what could be considered a landmark, Automobili Lamborghini was one of the first console games to allow both four player and AI opponents simultaneously.

Region: Japan
Genre: Shoot 'em Up
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Treasure
Publisher: ESP
Players: Single Player
Alternate Title: Bangai-O
_________________________
*
Plot

The game has a simple storyline (though slightly differing scripts among the Japanese, European, and North American releases) conveyed through intermission screens and dialogue interruptions, with character portraits and captions, triggered by approaching objects in normal play. Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami share command of the powerful humanoid-shaped Bangai-O and battle villains from the "Cosmo Gang", guilty of fruit contraband, and lots of gun turrets, bombs and robots through 44 levels.

Gameplay

Bangai-O, the player's mecha, is maneuvered via eight-way directional controls and fires in eight directions, controlled by the controller's four face buttons. There is a life bar and the levels can be retried from the beginning after dying. As opposed to most shoot 'em up games in which players effortlessly shoot through waves of enemies, the player is overwhelmed with enemy firepower, requiring strategy to figure out the best course of action to clear the level without dying.

Two firing modes are represented as switching between the two pilots (the current one is displayed at all times in a portrait): Riki fires red homing missiles and Mami fires blue lasers that bounce off walls.

There is a special attack that consists of a 360 degree burst of the current shot type. The number of shots fired by the special attack, 40 to 400, depends on how many enemy bullets are on the screen and how close the player is to them while firing. The missile special attack splits between multiple targets; the laser special attack points towards a target after bouncing.

At the beginning of a level two special shots are available; destroying enemies and scenery gives additional uses, up to five available shots, and this recharging effect is shown as a meter.

The number of explosions taking place at any given time is shown at the top of the screen and determines how much the special attack meter recharges and what type of fruit is left behind by destroyed enemies. Higher numbers of explosions yield more special energy and more valuable types of fruit. Therefore, the tactic of inviting substantial enemy fire in order to counter with the special attack is key to success at the game.

The original version of the game, released only in Japan and limited to 10,000 cartridges, has significant differences to the Dreamcast version.

    Utilizes a combo system instead of the explosion meter. After destroying at least 100 enemies in quick succession with a special attack or otherwise, the player gets a combo meter that tracks the number of enemies destroyed. When the combo stops, a portal opens that when touched opens a menu which allows the player to choose to upgrade their firepower, refill their life, take a large point bonus, or gain temporary invincibility. The level of the upgrades, life refill, and point bonus are determined by the size of the combo, invincibility is only given as an option from very large combos.
    The special attack is generally less effective. It must be charged (by holding down the button) in order to reach its full potential.
    Riki's shots do more damage than Mami's shots. Mami's shots are semi-homing in that they target enemies after bouncing off a wall.

The game opens on Spiral Mountain, home of Banjo, Kazooie and the witch Gruntilda. Gruntilda learns that the most beautiful girl of all is Tooty, Banjo's sister. Enraged, Gruntilda kidnaps Tooty. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Bottles the mole that Tooty was taken to Gruntilda's mountain lair, which they enter.

At the top of the tower, Gruntilda intends to swap her level of beauty with Tooty, thus making her young and beautiful while Tooty becomes a monster, using a machine created by her minion Klungo. To save Tooty, Banjo and Kazooie must travel through various worlds that branch from within the lair. In each world, they can collect up to ten jigsaw pieces, or "Jiggys", which can be used to unlock more worlds, as well as 100 musical notes, which open special doors that allow the two to progress deeper into the lair, and five Jinjos, small creatures that reward the two with a Jiggy whenever all are found in each world. Aiding them on their quest is Bottles, who teaches the two new moves and abilities, and the shaman Mumbo Jumbo, who transforms the two into various animals to accomplish certain tasks.

Deep in the lair, Banjo and Kazooie face Gruntilda in a trivia game ("Grunty's Furnace Fun"), with questions and challenges related to certain aspects of the game. If they win, they will win a prize of their choice, with Tooty being one of them; if they lose, they will be cast into a lava pit. The two win and rescue Tooty while Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie return home and celebrate with their friends with a barbecue, until Tooty reminds everyone that Gruntilda is still at large.

Banjo and Kazooie confront Gruntilda at the top of her tower for a final showdown. With the aid of the Jinjos they rescued, who dispatch a giant robot called the Jinjonator, and the two defeat Gruntilda, who falls to the ground and is buried underneath a boulder. Banjo and Kazooie return home and visit the beach with their friends, anticipating their next game. Gruntilda, with Klungo attempting to move the rock covering her, swears revenge.

Gameplay

Banjo-Kazooie is composed of nine non-linear 3D worlds in which the player must gather jigsaw pieces, or "Jiggies", to progress. Banjo and Kazooie are aided by Bottles, who teaches them new abilities, and Mumbo, who uses magical powers to transform them into other creatures, such as a termite, pumpkin, bumble bee, walrus, or crocodile.

Development

Banjo-Kazooie was originally known by the project name Dream for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The project starred a boy named Edison, who owned a wooden sword and got into trouble with a group of pirates led by Captain Blackeye. Dream was also scheduled to include a rabbit that looked like a man, a dopey dog, and a bear that became Banjo.[7] After its code was transferred to the Nintendo 64, it was shown at the 1997 E3 as Banjo-Kazooie.

The game received a significant amount of hype partly due to being marketed as the game that would be to the N64 what Donkey Kong Country was to the SNES in terms of an advancement in graphics. It was originally supposed to be released as Nintendo of America's big holiday game for 1997 with a Taco Bell toy promotion lined up, but Rare needed to delay it several months. Diddy Kong Racing took its place and features Banjo as a playable character.

Instead of dialogue, the characters make limited speech-like sounds when they talk, which are a looping of voice-like sounds. This choice was made due to memory limitations on Nintendo 64 cartridges. Rare considered using fully-voiced dialogue for the Xbox 360 game Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts, but ultimately retained the older style as it felt that the games had become known for it.

Overview 

Two years have passed since Banjo and Kazooie defeated the witch Gruntilda and buried her alive under a boulder. While the two are playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1. They destroy the boulder and free Gruntilda, her time spent underground having rotted her flesh away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie and Mumbo all escape in time, but Bottles is caught in the magical blast and killed. The three remaining friends decide to put an end to Gruntilda's plans.

Following the witches' trail, Banjo and Kazooie arrive at Jinjo Village in the Isle o' Hags, where King Jingaling, king of the Jinjos, explains that his subjects were frightened away by the Hag 1 and scattered throughout the island, and gives the two their first Jiggy to help find them. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters introduce her a cannon called the Big-O-Blaster (B.O.B.) that will restore her body by sucking the life force from any given target. They test B.O.B. on King Jingaling, who is turned into a zombie. Gruntilda plans to charge B.O.B. long enough to blast the entire island. The witch's most loyal minion Klungo is sent out to hinder Banjo and Kazooie in their progress by fighting them. After taking many beatings from Gruntilda as punishment for losing, Klungo eventually gives up and abandons her.

Finally reaching Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie confront Gruntilda and her sisters in another trivia game in which the losers will be flattened under one-ton weights. The two dispatch Mingella and Blobbelda while Gruntilda escapes once more. They then reverse the effects of B.O.B., bringing both King Jingaling and Bottles back to life. The two confront Gruntilda in the Hag 1, which explodes in the end and destroys most of Gruntilda's body, leaving her nothing more than a talking skull. Banjo and Kazooie return to Bottles' house with their friends to find that everyone else has celebrated without them. They decide to play kickball with Gruntilda's head, who swears to have her revenge in "Banjo-Threeie."

Gameplay

Similar to its predecessor Banjo-Kazooie, the game features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces ("Jiggies") that are used to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in Banjo-Kazooie, a singular board is used within a temple where Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.

Musical notes return in Banjo-Tooie, but are used to learn new moves from the drill sergeant Jamjars. He is the brother of Bottles and takes over Bottles's role from the first game. Mumbo Jumbo also returns as a playable character that can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Replacing Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a medicine woman and Mumbo's rival.

Another feature introduced in Banjo-Tooie is the interconnectedness of its worlds. In Banjo-Kazooie the titular duo would be magically transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair. In Banjo-Tooie the levels are physically connected at multiple points and are effectively extensions of the Isle o' Hags hub world. In addition, the train Chuffy can be used to migrate minor characters between some worlds that contain stations.

Reception

Banjo-Tooie was part of a long chain of critically and commercially successful games on the N64 from Rare upon the time of its release. However, due to being released at the end of the console's lifetime the game suffered from a mild depreciation in sales. The scores were consistently very high, rivaling its predecessor Banjo-Kazooie. IGN praised the multiplayer system and its characters but criticized the graphics for framespeed problems during certain points in the game.[11] Its release on Xbox Live was given an 8.5/10, five points more than its predecessor, although the lack of a map could make the game confusing, and the game was somewhat difficult.

Synopsis

On January 13, 2006, a Queenlord, Cassandra, is spying on Griffin Spade's family, telling her troops to kidnap Griffin's son Brandon and kill everyone else. Griffin and his army manage to push back the invaders, but Cassandra soon turns the tables by mind-controlling Griffin's own army. Griffin and Madison manage to escape San Francisco and begin chasing Cassandra across the United States, eventually cornering her in Washington, D.C.. Cassandra, however, escapes with Brandon to Great Britain; Griffin and Madison follow. They build a new army in Europe, and chase Cassandra through England, France and Germany. While in Paris, they discover Cassandra released the virus in 2001 to kill every female on Earth who didn't have the power of the Edge. It is in Berlin where Griffin finally rescues Brandon. They make it back to San Francisco and push back another invasion by the Storm Ravens, and finally corner and defeat Cassandra on Alcatraz Island.

Multiplayer in Global Assault allows players to play in almost all of the maps from campaign mode, as well as some which are exclusive to multiplayer. The maps usually are based on known landmarks and locations in the United States or Europe, such as Route 66, the White House, the British Houses of Parliament, and the Eiffel Tower.


Gangs

Global Assault features many gangs returning from the first game, as well as some new ones.

Griffin's Army: The main gang in the game. The player controls this gang in campaign mode.

Madison's Militia: A separate gang run by Madison, they do not appear in campaign.

Brandon's Gang: A secret gang, apparently run by Brandon. The campaign must be completed with the secret level unlocked to gain access to this gang.

Cassandra's Gang: A second secret gang, ran by the main Antagonist Cassandra. Unlocked via a GameShark code. Possesses high end tanks, including two of the normally unplayable "Tankbossa" Gatling Gun Goliaths.

Skull Riders: A small gang consisting mostly of Moto Tanks and Rattlers, recruited by Cassandra in Texas.

Storm Ravens: The secret female-only gang from the last game is now playable from the beginning. They have also been recruited by Cassandra.

Shadow Ops: A gang controlled by Cassandra in Washington, D.C.

Iron Maidens: A British female-only gang rescued by Griffin when he first lands in Europe.

Crimson Guard: Another British gang, enemies of the Iron Maidens and controlled by Cassandra.

Les Misérables: Cassandra's French recruits.

Dark Angels: A cult society. Despite their importance in the first game's plot, they play no role in Global Assault.

Cold Warriors: A unique gang, whose only single-player appearance is in the Germany levels. In multiplayer mode, one player in the gang will on occasion spawn with the Nuke. A Cold Warriors' Goliath can be found in Berlin War Zone, in a tunnel in an alleyway, to the left after you cross the minefield.

Custom Gang: A special gang that can only be unlocked using a special cheat code. By entering the cheat code "TRDDYBRRKS" and then entering any combination of letters/numbers/symbols, a custom gang can be created with a random selection of tanks & starting weapons. For example, entering "VCTRY" results in a gang with 2 M1 Abrams tanks, 3 Goliath tanks, & Swarmers for a starting weapon. Up to 4 custom gangs can be made at a time. Attempting to create a 5th gang will result in Custom Gang 1 being overwritten. Also, the Custom Gangs are not saved to the memory card, so the code must be re-entered if one wishes to have the Custom Gangs again.

Items & Weaponry

In addition to some new items, most of the items have returned from the original Battletanx.

    Radar: Indicates location of enemies.
    Tank Bucks: Allows the purchase of tanks. (Campaign only)
    Ammo: Restores a set amount of ammunition to the tank's main weapon.
    Health: Adds several units of health to the tank's life bar. If life is full, this item is stored in the inventory for later use.
    Star: It adds ammo and life to the tank.
    Cloaking Device: Makes the player temporarily invisible. A+B (special attack) creates a fake image of the player's tank to distract enemies.
    Swarmers: Three missiles are fired off. Special attack fires many of them.
    Flamethrower: Short range stream; special attack fires in three directions.
    Laser: Fires a high-powered, super-fast laser. Special attack fires fifteen lasers that bounce around, potentially hitting several enemies in an enclosed area.
    Guided Missiles: Fired missile controlled by player. Special attack fires an upgraded missile with a laser attack.
    Mines: Drops an anti-tank mine on the player's location. Can harm self and allies; special attack lays multiple mines at once to create a minefield.
    Plasma Bolts: Shoots a fast bolt that bounces off buildings and walls. Special attack fires off a huge spray of them, best used when not facing a close wall.
    Bouncing Betties: Bouncing mines that fire lasers. Special attack lays a whole field of them.
    Grenades: A hand grenade that can fly over obstacles. Special attack fires a huge grenade.
    Gun Buddies: Places a gun emplacement. Special attack creates a whole host of them.

Battlezone - Rise of the Black Dogs
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Strategy > Realtime
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Climax Group
Publisher: Crave Entertainment
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Battlezone offers three modes of single-player play in addition to a comprehensive set of training missions. Arcade mode harkens back to the original Battlezone, and consists of destroying every other vehicle on the map. Pilot and Commander modes follow the campaign, the difference being that in Commander mode, the player is responsible for constructing a base and can issue orders to fellow units.

Compared to the PC version released a year earlier, the game's multiplayer is very limited. The game features a standard Deathmatch mode where up to four players combat each other and a number of computer-controlled bots, a race mode where the objective is to navigate from one beacon to another for a set number of laps, and a strategy mode in which players choose three computer-controlled bots to assist them and simply attempt to eliminate all other players.

Story

Factions

Three rival factions come to play in the game: The United States, the Soviet Union, and an elite team of mercenaries known as the Black Dogs. The game takes place in an alternate version of the 1960s in which the United States and the Soviet Union use alien technology to wage a secret war across the solar system, fighting for control of the rare resource bio-metal.

Plot

The game begins during the Cold War with the Americans and the Soviets discovering a substance called bio-metal in some meteorites, which can be used to build vehicles with previously impossible abilities. They use this new substance to start a war that is fought throughout the solar system.

During the war, the Americans and Soviets discover an artifact and a weapons factory on Mars built by the same race of aliens that created the bio-metal. It is revealed that this race of aliens once occupied a planet sharing an orbit with the asteroid belt. They fought a civil war that raged throughout the solar system, until one side built an ultimate weapon to destroy the other side. The Americans and Soviets begin to look for this weapon.

The Americans find a piece of it on Jupiter’s moon, Io. However, while the Americans are transporting it, the Soviets capture it. By the time the Americans find where the Soviets took the piece, the Soviets have already built a prototype of the weapon, called a Fury, and have begun mass production. When the Americans arrive at the Soviet base on Titan, where the Furies are being kept, they discover that the Furies have turned on the Soviets and destroyed their base. The Americans and Soviets agree to join forces against the Furies.

The Furies escape the coalition forces and set up a new base on a moon of Uranus. The coalition forces engage the Furies on the moon, which results in the destruction of the Furies and the moon.

Gameplay

Despite the use of real vehicles, the gameplay is much more in line with San Francisco Rush than it is with Gran Turismo, with an emphasis on shortcuts. In Australia there was a second release known as HSV Adventure Racing, which used the same engine but had HSV cars in place of the Beetles.

Beetle Adventure Racing supports up to four players. Two player races can be held in any of the tracks, provided they have been unlocked in the single player championship. Two to four players can also take part in the "Beetle Battle" mode, in which players compete to collect six differently colored ladybugs (HSV pendants in HSV Adventure Racing), attempt to destroy the other competitors, and race for the exit once all the ladybugs are collected.`

Music

The music in BAR is a groovy, breakbeat soundtrack with loud drums, organs, and guitars. The music was composed by Phil Western, Scott Blackwood and Brenden Tennant. Scott Blackwood also served as Producer for BAR.

The level Mount Mayhem samples music from WHAM!'s "Last Christmas".


Reception

GameSpot rated the game 8.5, claiming it is a "great deal of fun".

The Story
The World of Neo-Amerika

In the not-too-distant future, the mighty country known as America has fallen like all great empires throughout history. Its fifty states broken into private territories after what was called... The Techno-Industrial Civil Wars. Computer technology, bio-engineering, cybernetics and mechanics accelerated at such an incredible rate, it forced industrial competition to the point of uncontrollable and ruthless corporate espionage.

While the government tried to keep control of the country by a single thread, the effect of the giant corporations' white collar wars drove the economy into a tail spin. With Wall Street in shambles, the government bankrupt and technological corporate giants running unorthodox takeovers, Neo-Amerika was born. Starting with Micro-Gene, a Dallas based microchip / bio engineering company, New Mexico was easily annexed by the construction of more micro-chip processing plants and cloning technology labs. Arizona was the company's next target and by the time Micro-Gene moved in on Nevada, things started to get ugly. Micro-Gene had been using enhanced agents to spy, sabotage and gather information on competing companies, but other competitors began fighting back with their own brand of genetically enhanced corporate spies and agents.

These wars between giant corporations a.k.a. "GI-Corps", gave way to more complicated, advanced and unethical methods. The kidnapping of corporate executives and replacing them with clones capable of downloading company secrets was becoming commonplace. Soon, murder and terrorist tactics became tools of choice in the battle between the GI-Corps.

With the advent of the GI-Corps battles, each State developed desperate measures to secure themselves from a hostile take-over. By declaring Federal independence from the U.S., drastic laws and borders were created between states. Violence soon reared its ugly head and the Techno-Industrial Civil Wars began.

Something had to be done before the once great country destroyed itself or became target to outside invasion. An agreement had to be made between the government and the GI-Corps before America was torn apart. So a radical concept was introduced to prevent the possible loss of millions in the increasing wars between GI-Corp controlled states. Thus...

Overview

The game uses a fully polygonal fighting engine, with 8 different fighters, and 2 boss fighters. It sets itself apart from the majority of fighting games by not locking the players down to a 2D plane of combat, allowing the players to move in full 3D including flying into the air for short periods. This allows you to move to higher levels in the arenas, of which there are 10, though only 9 are selectable in Vs. modes. Some of the arenas also have traps which can damage the characters or even kill them immediately.

Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. uses a mix of hand-to-hand and long range combat. Each character has an assortment of special attacks, both close and long range, as well as 'finishing attacks'. Much like the Fatalities of the Mortal Kombat games these moves can execute your opponents while some, like in Time Killers, will remove limbs. Also damage from powerful attacks can add up causing a limb to be destroyed as well.

Limb Loss can be shut off, however, just as the blood can. You can even configure it to allow limbs to regrow after a while or stay missing for the rest of the battle. Limbs lost during the first round return, either way, at the start of the second.

Gameplay

The fully 3D nature of the game yields a different style of gameplay from the traditional fighting game. Players are able to not only move forward, backward, sidestep, and jump but also to fly away to a safe distance or speed dash in for close combat.

The players could stay close range for a more traditional experience, go long range and volley and dodge shots from each other, or play cat and mouse as one person continually moves across the room and the other speed dashes after them.

The game also has the buttons dedicated to a specific limb instead of level of strength. This makes it a more intuitive control with the four face buttons grafted to the limbs and the shoulder buttons used for dodging, flying, and your basic long range attack.

Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. offers several gameplay modes. The standard Arcade Mode which allows you to battle in a series of one-on-one battles against the other A.I. operated characters of the game, including the two bosses. The also standard Vs Mode where you can battle one-on-one against another person. There is also a Practice Mode so you can learn the controls of the game.

The other two game modes are Team Battle allowing you to play against the computer or another person in anything from two-on-two to five-on-five battles and Survival Mode which cannot actually be won as you fight each character again and again getting as many wins as you can before being defeated yourself.

Plot

Two defective nuclear missiles are being moved to a safe location for a controlled detonation. The missiles begin to leak and the carrier vehicle transporting the missiles is automatically set onto a direct course to the detonation site. As the course takes it through many built-up areas, there are many obstacles on the way, and a single jolt could be enough to detonate the missiles and trigger a nuclear winter. The Blast Corps demolition company is given the task of clearing a safe route for the carrier and its missiles.

Gameplay

The game starts on a world map with only one accessible carrier level. Beating this level opens the "easy" set of carrier levels. When these are beaten, the next set of carrier levels is opened. Bonus levels are earned by finding and activating communication devices hidden in some levels. And so, the game expands from a single carrier level to many different levels of two types (carrier and bonus).

Each level is initially marked with a shadow, but this can be filled with a medal by fulfilling the secondary requirements of a carrier mission (by destroying buildings, freeing survivors, and collecting RDUs), or by getting a good enough time in a Bonus mission. Each level is also circled in a green or red outline. A green outline means that there is at least one comm. device in the level that has not been found, whereas a red outline means that all of the satellites in the level have been found.

The first objective in the game is to clear all of the carrier levels, but many more tasks await afterwards.

Plot

The opening text tells of how an alien force has harvested the population of Earth over a 100 year time period. Every 25 years they would land and imprison whole areas in shields that prevented anyone from leaving and any outside help getting in. The aliens would harvest the population of the area within a time limit of one day before moving on to another area. After repeating this several times they would teleport back to their homeworld, an artificially created comet, before returning exactly 25 years later as it has completed its orbit around the nearby star systems back to earth. Greece was the first targeted area in 1916, southern Spain was second, eastern Canada was third, and the south island of Japan was fourth. In 1941 the first targeted area was Java. In 1966 it was the U.S (presumably somewhere in the southwest in between Nevada and Arizona) and finally in 1991 it was Siberia. The player only has to stop the aliens in the first area that they target in order to save every future targeted area of that time period.[2]

The opening cutscene shows Station Omega, an orbital space station containing Earth's last survivors. The year is 2016 and the aliens have returned to destroy the last remnant of the human race. The aliens attack and board Station Omega, chasing Adam Drake, the game's only playable character, through the corridors. Even though Adam defeats the initial invaders he is wounded in the process. He is ready to board Alpha I, the time traveling vehicle developed at Station Omega, when more aliens appear and try to force their way into the boarding chamber. The monitors show his colleague, Daisy Hernandez, telling Adam to get into the Alpha I without letting the aliens gain access to it. As the aliens force the door open, Adam dives through the air lock and fires a single shot into the control panel; this closes the door and prevents the aliens from pursuing him further. As they escape the station in the Alpha I, they are pursued by Alien fighter craft, but open up a time portal and escape. Meanwhile, back on Station Omega, an Alien is shown holding a drop of Adam's blood and eyes it strangely. This is a subtle hint as to where Adam's arch nemesis, Tomegatherion, is cloned from

Gameplay

Each level in Body Harvest requires the player to stop the aliens from slaughtering everyone in the shield area. The player will navigate the map, often coming across towns where aliens will teleport in to attack the town and harvest civilians. Aliens will also warp in frequently to attack the player and can appear from the land, air or sea. Generally, gameplay consists of completing a series of missions. Many of these are very basic, e.g. reach a certain area, but others can be more complicated and require careful thought and skill. Once the player completes a mission they are prompted to check the map to find out what the next mission is.

There is a meter at the bottom of the screen that represents civilian casualties. If too many civilians die for any reason (including friendly-fire), the aliens will destroy the area and the mission will have failed. Generally, only Harvester aliens deliberately kill civilians, but the player must be careful not to shoot or run down any civilians in the process of rescuing them. The player must react to Harvester Waves quickly, as if the aliens manage to harvest 8 humans in a single wave they will create an extremely dangerous 'Mutant' creature, which immediately attacks the player regardless of location. There are also several optional missions that require saving people from the aliens, and although one can fail these missions and still progress through the game, doing so will result in significant human casualties.

The use of vehicles is a key aspect of this game. Vehicles provide significant protection from alien attacks and allow the player to travel at a far greater speed than on foot. Adam can still fire most weapons from within a vehicle, although many vehicles are equipped with powerful weapons of their own. Vehicles take damage independently of Adam and can be repaired with health pickups spawned by defeating larger aliens. Specific vehicles are often required to advance - for example, boats allow travel over bodies of water, while planes and helicopters allow travel through the air. Each vehicle has a unique combination of top speed, armor and fuel capacity, inviting players to consider their options carefully. Vehicles range from mundane civilian forms of transport to powerful military hardware - the player will pilot tanks, armored cars and aircraft as frequently as cars, trucks and motorcycles. In addition, the Alpha I (the ship the player uses to travel through time) becomes a powerful armored hovercraft during boss battles and for the entirety of the Comet level.

There are many buildings in each stage which can be entered on foot, many of which are essential to talk to plot characters and acquire necessary items. Buildings also contain health pickups, new weapons, various ammunition pickups and fuel cans (of which one will refuel a vehicle once). With thorough exploration, rarer items can be found including alien artifacts and 'weapon crystals', three of which combine to form a technologically advanced weapon unique to that level.

The eventual goal of each level is to destroy the Shield Generator to remove the shield that surrounds the region. To do this, the player must first destroy a number of Alien Processors, which act as sub-bosses. Defeating an Alien Processor opens a gateway to the next area and allows the player to save their progress. Once the Shield Generator itself has been destroyed, the player immediately faces that level's boss. Once the boss is defeated, the player travels forward in time and to the next level.

Story

In the game's opening sequence, a peaceful-looking planet with gardens, rivers, and residential buildings abound is shown. Seconds later, the space pirate, Artemis, drops from the sky with a band of soldiers and orders them to raid the planet. Meanwhile, Altair (the leader of the space pirates), watches from the Black Fortress, using his coveted weapon, the Omni Cube, to completely drain the planet's energy, condemning it to a zombie-like state.

Artemis returns to the Black Fortress to meet up with her partners, fellow pirates Orion and Regulus and her superior, Altair. Together, they set their sights on their next target: Planet Bomber, home of the protagonist, Bomberman. They maneuver their fortress into the atmosphere of Planet Bomber.

Bomberman, from atop a cliff, observes the Black Fortress' descent. Not much later, the Fortress begins to open fire on the people of Planet Bomber, firing destructive energy rays into populated areas.

A warrior clad in white then flies out to the surprised Bomberman, and asks if he plans to defeat the assailants. Bomberman gives an affirmative response, and the stranger (later introduced as Sirius) explains that a force field protects the Fortress from any outside attack. Sirius goes on to say that this force field can be deactivated by destroying the four anchors attached to the Fortress; the "Green Garden": a ruin-filled natural world, "Blue Resort": a fortress surrounded by water, "Red Mountain": a large volcano fraught with danger, and "White Glacier": a large, snowy mountain covered in ice. Once inside the Fortress, they must find and destroy Altair.

Bomberman successfully climbs onto and destroys the four anchors with the help of Sirius, who helps him by supplying power-ups and teaching him new techniques. Once force field around the Fortress is deactivated, the duo enter the Fortress. After sneaking through Altair's security measures, Bomberman finds and confronts Altair, and after a difficult struggle, defeats the pirate. The previously defeated Regulus swoops in and attempts to rescue his master from the battlefield, but is then knocked away by Sirius. Altair drops the Omni Cube, which Sirius lands on the battle platform to retrieve. At this point, Altair is annihilated by a newly powered-up Sirius. Sirius reveals that he was only using Bomberman's abilities into taking back the Omni Cube which was stolen by Altair, adding that he was sick of working with him and lying to him during the mission. He then takes the Omni Cube and escapes to his secret lair to destroy Planet Bomber.

Bomberman pursues him, successfully making his way through the palace, confronting Sirius for his betrayal. When Sirius is about to fire on Bomberman, he is saved by Regulus, knocking him away and destroying the Omni cube. With the aid of Regulus, Bomberman succeeds and defeats Sirius. Without the power of the Omnicube, The Rainbow Palace crashes into the Black Fortress, destroying both, as Regulus escapes with Bomberman, informing him that he was quite surprised with Bomberman's ability to defeat Sirius, as he and his comrades had considerable difficulty taking the Omnicube from Sirius. Regulus leaves Planet Bomber, stating that one day he will have a rematch with his new rival, Bomberman, who celebrates his victory.

Gameplay

This game is featured in full 3D, thus the directional controls change. Bomberman is able to walk in eight directions with a rotating camera facing in eight directions and with three different zooms. His bombs have a different effect than in other games of the series; the bomb's explosion waves have a spherical pattern rather than the traditional cross-shaped ones.

In both single player and multiplayer modes, Bomberman always has the ability to kick, pick up, and throw bombs, without the need of powerups, as in previous games. A unique feature of this game is that Bomberman can "pump" a bomb while holding it, which will make the bomb's explosion more powerful. A pumped-up bomb cannot be kicked or picked up again. Unlike most platform games of its time, Bomberman cannot jump, nor can he swim in water, although he can wade in shallow water. Since Bomberman lacks the ability to jump, higher areas that do not have a path leading to them must be reached by bouncing across bombs - typically this requires the "remote" power-up to avoid the normally timed bombs exploding early. "Bomb jumping" is actually required to fully explore most levels, retrieve certain power-ups, and cross many obstacles.

If Bomberman runs into an enemy NPC, or is hit on the head by a small object, such as an unexploded bomb, he will get dizzy temporarily (he will sit there dizzy with "X" eyes and stars rotating around his head). While in this state, he can get picked up by an enemy and thrown around or even off the map. Conversely, Bomberman can do the same to an enemy.

When Bomberman takes damage, he dies. If he has a "heart" power-up when he's hit, he will survive, but he will lose the heart. When he dies all powerups that he had obtained will scatter all over the place. In the Normal single-player mode, taking damage simply causes Bomberman to drop the heart, and if it doesn't bounce off the level, he can pick it up again to survive another hit. In the Hard mode, the heart will simply disappear. The Game has 4 bosses Artemis the only female boss, shoots fiery feathers at bomberman and kicks bombs at him just like all other bosses, she can also like all other bosses dizzy bomberman by touching him on hard mode. orion his goal is to dizzy bomberman with a sheild and hoist him up and through him in lava an also dizzy bomberman by touching him on hard. regulus he trys to do a dash at bomberman if he catches bomberman he hurts him with combat moves such as punches and kicks. can also dizzy bomberman by touching him on hard mode and sirius the guy who helps bomberman through the adventure challenges bomberman to a match he does exactly what bomberman can do he also can dizzy bomberman by touching him on hard mode.


Game progression

At the start of the game, Bomberman can enter any of four anchors, which are terrariums of other planets (that were probably drained by Altair). The starting worlds are: Green Garden, Blue Resort, Red Mountain, and White Glacier. In each anchor there are four stages. The first and third stages are adventure stages where Bomberman must navigate through the stage by solving puzzles and blasting his way toward the "Goal Arrow." The second and fourth stages are boss stages, Bomberman must fight Sirius or one of Altair's subordinates in the second stage, and he must fight the world's guardian in the fourth.

After Bomberman beats the first four anchors, he can enter the Black Fortress. Like the previous worlds, the first and third stages are adventure stages, but this time Bomberman must fight the guardian in the second stage and Altair himself in the fourth stage.

In every stage there are five gold cards to collect (100 total). Once all gold cards have been collected, the player can unlock the secret world, Rainbow Palace. After all the gold cards have been collected from there (an additional 20, making a grand total of 120 Gold Cards) the player unlocks more courses in multiplayer mode plus the "Full Power" cheat option. With the cheat activated, Bomberman starts with 8 bombs, 5 flames, power bombs, and remote bombs.

Platform: Nintendo 64

Genre: Action
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Hudson Soft
Publisher: Vatical Entertainment
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Baku Bomberman 2

Story

In The Second Attack, Bomberman finds a mysterious egg while celebrating his victory over Altair and Sirius on a hot spring planet and decides to take it with him while exploring space in his ship. One day, however, Bomberman's ship gets sucked into a black hole, and he wakes up to find himself in a jail. While in jail, the egg suddenly begins to hatch. The creature inside turns out to be a charabom named Pommy. With the help of Pommy, Bomberman is able to escape.

Bomberman learns there are some elemental crystals being collected by the evil Rukifellth, and the Astral Knights, that hold the current crystals. They are missing the fire crystal which Bomberman has. It's up to Bomberman and Pommy to stop the new evil and retrieve the crystals. Along the way, he meets Lilith, a girl apparently working toward the same goal he is. He meets her on many occasions.

Little does Bomberman know that one of the knights is none other than Regulus (now under the name Bulzeeb), who still hasn't forgotten their last battle and his vow to settle their differences once and for all.

Gameplay

In many aspects, the game plays identical to Bomberman 64. There is no jumping, there are pump-able bombs, bomb kicking is possible and the player has the ability to remotely detonate bombs. However, as opposed to the circular explosions of the first Nintendo 64 titles, the explosions in The Second Attack are the traditional cross "+" shape, and is the explosion style for almost all the attribute bombs.

In addition to these, Second Attack brought many new features to the game as well, such as:

    More bosses and levels
    The ability to use the different element crystals with bombs to create certain element explosions
    A space shop to buy more heart containers, multiplayer stages to fight on, and the move list of the next elemental astral knight to be fought
    Hidden armor pieces that will allow Bomberman to kick bombs without needing the bomb kick item, the ability to throw and pump bombs without the throw item, and the ability to use remote bombs without need of the remote bomb item
    Raise Pommy, a fighting partner, by giving him different types of foods. Pommy can also be played by a second human player with a second controller.

Story

The story is similar to (and even could have been based upon) Star Wars; a princess steals a secret data disk from an evil empire, and she safely smuggles out the information through a robot, but is captured herself. Bomberman is training in his headquarters when news arrives about the princess being captured. Bomberman chases after the Garaden Empire to save the Princess, but the Empire eventually claims back the disks to rebuild their leader, Bagular, whose body was destroyed in Super Bomberman 3.

At first Bomberman travels through four worlds; Planet Bomber, Primus Star, Kanatia Star, and Mazone Star. Each world has its respective boss from the Garaden Empire; Endol, Barudia, Bolban, Natia and Cronus. Within each world there are different areas with their own collection of stages. Towards the middle of a world Bomberman encounters Nitros, a mysterious recurring mini-boss similar to Bomberman. While on his adventure Bomberman encounters characters from past games such as Black Bomber and Louie. The basic plot for the first three worlds is that Bomberman chases after Princess Millian only to find that she has been transported to the next world. While on Mazone area three, Bomberman finds Princess Millian safe in a lab. She tells him to find the rest of the disks in the next few levels. After giving the disks to Princess Millian she turns out to be Natia in disguise. Natia then sends the disks needed to rebuild Bagular to the Garaden base. After Bomberman battles Natia and her robot pet Cronus he sets out towards Garaden Star. Within Garaden Star Bomberman battles resurrected forms of the past boss' through the various stages. Towards the middle of the world Bomberman encounters Nitros for a final battle. After the battle, Nitros snaps out of his brainwashed state, explains himself to Bomberman, shares his power with Bomberman, and then tells him to defeat Bagular for him. At the end of the world Bomberman meets up with the recently resurrected Bagular and engages him in an epic (and rather odd) final battle. As a final act of desperation Bagular self destructs Garaden Star in an attempt to kill Bomberman. The story seems to end here with the destruction of the Garaden Empire and the credits. Although, after obtaining a perfect score on every level and by collecting all the Adok bombs a new cutscene takes place after the destruction of Garaden Star. A mysterious figure says “Bagular you fool, you lost again!” and suddenly the final world Gossick Star appears. At the end of the second level Bomberman ascends the elevator to the final battle. There he battles Evil Bomber, the possible real mastermind of the operation. After defeating Evil Bomber, Bomberman flies away in a spaceship with Princess Millian and the credits run.

Gameplay

Bomberman Hero controls very differently from Bomberman 64. In Hero, the character can jump, has a life meter, faces tougher bosses, and has the ability to throw bombs farther, thus, making Hero a more platform oriented experience. There are several different areas to be encountered, each with about five different stages. A unique feature is that it's possible to play with an extra advancement, such as a jet pack or a submarine.

There are also several different types of bombs in addition to the regular ones. Ice bombs turn enemies into a block of ice which can be moved around and used to jump on to get to higher places. Salt bombs only harm slugs, which cannot be harmed by any other means. Control bombs explode when remotely detonated; a useful ability against certain bosses.

Much of the game's replay value is in the sub-mission of scoring the amount of target points per stage, which awards Bomberman a certain amount of stage points (1 through 5) at the end of each level. You can re-enter the stages as often as you like, in order to secure the highest possible score within the stage. Medals are awarded on a per-planet basis, awarded based on the total number of stage points at the planet's completion (red, blue, bronze, silver, and gold). Getting a perfect score on every planet (or rather, a gold medal on each one) will award mini games to be accessed on the options screen. The games include:

SLIDE RACER: Play through the Crystal Hole level on the Bomber Slider, racing against a snowman. Beat him and get the record time to win.

GOLDEN BOMBER: Bomberman gets the Golden Chip, which allows him to travel underwater with ease. Traverse through three stages to beat the Boss of the Woods.

TREASURE HUNT: Princess Millian's ship, which was full of treasure taken from Bagular's base, was shot down at the treasures were scattered all over the six planets. Find them all.

Like the previous Nintendo 64 Bomberman game, Hero was advertised using a remixed and reworded version of the classic Spider Man theme song

Publisher: Konami
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________

Gameplay

One of the earliest in Konami's franchise, this version featured 300 actual MLB players at the time, but did not feature the MLB licensed teams. Players can choose to either play against a friend in Exhibition, Season or Playoffs. The gameplay is geared for more of a simulation style of play with the players stats determining on how well they hit, pitch and field. For example, hit a home run with the last ball of the match, or stop a team from scoring in the final inning to complete each scenario. Training and support for 2 player multi-player are also available.

Along with the standard modes for a baseball game, this one also featured the ability to customize their teams and choose any player to create their "Dream Team". It also had a variety of different camera angles to choose from and had meters to show their players progress such as a "Streak Bar" that showed a batters hitting ability and a "Pitching Bar" that showed whether a pitcher was fatigued.


Bottom of the 9th is a baseball game by Konami for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. It is a heavily updated version of Konami's 1989 arcade game Bottom of the Ninth [1]. It was originally released for the Sega Saturn.

Buck Bumble
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Action
Release Year: 1998
Developer: Argonaut Games
Publisher: Ubisoft
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Plot

The game casts the player as a cyborg bee, Buck Bumble, part of an organization known as "The resistance." It is Buck's duty to stop the evil Herd Army, bugs that have been mutated by chemicals spilled into a garden, who are bent on taking over the garden, and eventually the whole world. Buck is armed with 15 different weapons, including a Tesla gun, a rocket launcher, and an RC missile launcher. While the levels are height restricted, Buck can fly around in 19 missions, some requiring the placement of a bomb without dropping it.

Buck's missions send him to defend the resistance base, attacking Herd supply lines, traveling through sewers, and eventually fighting the Herd's mantis style Queen.

Multiplayer

Buck Bumble has two multiplayer modes. The first, Buzz Battle, allows up to two players to engage in an airborne dog-fight on a preset map. The second is a football orientated game called Buzz Ball. The goal is to hit a giant football into the opposing player's net. Just like in Buzz Battle, the player has the ability to kill his or her opponent in the process. Players are able to use two weapons from the game; a simple zapper, which gently moves the ball along, and a rocket launcher, which sends the ball flying in a different direction.

Reception

While not heavily praised, and widely regarded as below contemporary N64 standards, Buck Bumble was met with overall positive reception from various gaming critics. Matt Casamassina of IGN called it "the epitome of 'first generation' Nintendo 64 products" and compared it to a lower quality version of the bee level in Banjo-Kazooie. This is largely due to its heavy distance fog, low frame rate, and low resolution graphics. Casamassina also considered the single player levels too short and too easy. However, he praised the flying controls, the design of the title character, and addictiveness of the Buzz Ball multiplayer mode.

GameSpot's Lauren Fielder gave the title a significantly lower review than most publishers and echoed the believe that it "missed the boat" of lower quality, first generation N64 games. She criticised the flying and walking controls and deemed the multiplayer modes "seemingly quite literally thrown in." She closed by saying "In spite of all the obvious flaws, Buck Bumble is not a terrible game. It's just not a good game, and the rewards do not make up for the dull, tugging experience it quickly becomes."

A much more positive review came from Nintendojo. They stated that, while fog makes navigation difficult, "the graphics do not disappoint." In terms of multiplayer, the "extremely difficult" Buzz Battle was considered much less enjoyable than Buzz Ball. The review summed up stating, "Buck Bumble is definitely worth playing. While it isn't perfect, it's a fun game, and that's what really counts."

Bust-A-Move '99

Release Year: 1999
Developer: Taito
Publisher: Taito, Acclaim
Players: Single player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Puzzle Bobble 64

Description

Think you've busted with the best? Not until you've faced Bust-A-Move '99! With intense 4-player competition, all new graphics, and create-a-level mode, you've never busted bubbles like these! And with eight new mysterious characters to save, you'll be bustin' like crazy to solve all the puzzles and send them home!

Characters

In the single player modes, there is nothing to distinguish the characters. However in two player modes, the characters differ by the bubbles they can place onto the other players screen.

    * Bub and Bob are the series' main protagonists. Both are anthropomorphic dinosaurs- Bub is green whereas Bob is blue. Bub is the elder of the two and is known to be energetic; Bob is much quieter. Although claimed to both be the heroes, Bub features much more prominently.

    * Musashi a warrior from Musashi no Ken – Tadaima Shugyo Chu (another game by Taito) who is bearing a resemblance to Ryu.

    * Prettio a small green and white doll who at the end of her story is caught from a toy-crane machine by one of Marina's friends and is cared for.

    * Twinkle/Chincle a young girl dressed in a jester's costume. At the end of her story, she is shown to be a normal schoolgirl.

    * Marina

    * Luna

    * Blaster Man/SSB

    * Jack

    * Drank



Where Bust-A-Move 99 for the N64 really shines is in the three- or four-player modes. These modes are engaging enough to keep you playing after you've long since tired of a simple two-player game. One complaint, however, is that (in what appears to be an obvious developer oversight) you're stuck with four game spaces on the TV monitor, whether you're in a three-player or four-player game. Because of this, the screens are really tiny, with silly pictures of your respective character under your playing space taking up about one fifth of your panel of the monitor. This makes no sense. Clearly, resolution issues were at play, but why not just present three spaces for a three-player game? The N64 version, like the PlayStation game, suffered from the occasional cluttered background, making the bubbles occasionally difficult to see. However, this wasn't consistently the case and therefore didn't really damage gameplay. And aside from a few sound glitches between levels, the cartridge didn't do much to damage the music. Could it, anyway?

Bust-A-Move 2 - Arcade Edition

Bust-A-Move 2 is the first sequel to "Bust-A-Move", and is also known as Puzzle Bobble 2 outside Europe and North America. Released into the arcades in 1995, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PC conversions followed. The game was included in Taito Legends 2, but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead. The game is a spin-off from Bubble Bobble.

The game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game, allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next, leading to different game endings. Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta.

Some versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other.

Completion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble. The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence.

Id this a hack? - MM?

Puzzle Bobble 3 (also known as Bust-A-Move 3) is the second sequel to Puzzle Bobble. It was released into arcades in 1996 and later ported to the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64 and PC[citation needed]. It would be the final appearance of Puzzle Bobble on the Sega Saturn. Like its predecessors, the player is tasked with shooting balls at groups of balls, creating groups of 3 or more, which are then removed from play. A North American remake is entitled Bust-a-Move '99.

The game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line). Despite this some versions include a reimplementation of the Puzzle Bobble 2 levels now built around nodes (entitled Version 2.5).

Gameplay is further varied by the implementation of new scrolling playfields that are several times as high as the screen and must be conquered as an endurance event. Each scrolling playfield occupies the same space on the world map as five previous levels.

This game also marks the introduction of rainbow bubbles into the series - bubbles that are initially transparent and filled with a rainbow. Any adjoining bubble that is burst, the rainbow bubbles next to them switch to the colour of the burst bubble, allowing the player to build up chain reactions.

The ability to choose a character was introduced, but only to the VS Computer mode. As in Bubble Bobble, the 1st player, when he/she picks Bub, gets Bub, and the 2nd player gets Bob. In the Nintendo 64 version, a 4 player simultaneous option is available.

Characters

In the single player modes, there is nothing to distinguish the characters. However in two player modes, the characters differ by the bubbles they can place onto the other players screen.

    Bub and Bob are the series' main protagonists. Both are anthropomorphic dinosaurs- Bub is green whereas Bob is blue. Bub is the elder of the two and is known to be energetic; Bob is much quieter. Although claimed to both be the heroes, Bub features much more prominently.

    Twinkle/Chincle a young girl dressed in a jester's costume. At the end of her story, she is shown to be a normal schoolgirl.

    Marina

    Luna a gypsy fortune teller and a witch, she is on good terms with Drank, and they actually spend a lot of time together, despite appearing as his enemy to the general public.

Carmageddon 64
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Vehicular Combat
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Stainless Games
Publisher: SCi, Interplay
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
In Carmageddon, the player races a vehicle against a number of other computer controlled competitors in various settings, including city, mine and industrial areas. The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars or by running over pedestrians.

Races are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, "wasting" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level.

The game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics and for its in-game movie making features. It was also one of the earliest examples of sandbox 3D driving games, and may have influenced other later games including Driver and the Grand Theft Auto series.

The game featured instrumental versions of songs from Fear Factory's album Demanufacture, with the song Zero Signal being used in the game's intro. The other songs from the album that appear are Demanufacture and Body Hammer.


Development

The game that became Carmageddon started out as "3D Destruction Derby", a Banger racing sim prototyped by Stainless Software. This was signed by SCi in 1995, but the banger-racing angle was soon dropped and for a while the game was to use the Mad Max license. This fell through, and was replaced by the Death Race 2000 license, as a sequel to the original film was at that time planned (it eventually emerged as a comic book).[1] This introduced the running-over of pedestrians into the game.

When this license also fell through, SCi and Stainless took the decision to proceed with the game anyway, creating their own IP. The name "Carmageddon" was coined, and development proceeded with the designers allowed unusually free rein with regard to the content of the game.

Plot

Dracula reawakens in 1852, after nearly sixty years of enforced slumber, as a result of humankind's descent into vice and wickedness. Two young heroes sense his return: Carrie Fernandez, a girl gifted with magic powers, and Reinhardt Schneider, heir to the ancient Belmont clan of vampire hunters. The two set out to storm the Count's castle in the Transylvanian province of Wallachia and vanquish him.

As they penetrate the castle walls, an aristocratic vampire appears to warn Carrie and Reinhardt that "all who oppose the Dark Lord will die."[1] The two then come upon a decrepit villa, where they meet the elderly vampire hunter Charles Vincent, beautiful yet unwilling vampire Rosa, demonic salesman Renon, and young boy Malus. Beneath the estate's maze garden lies a subterranean path to the castle's center, where Dracula's servants (Actrise and Death) attempt to waylay the heroes by pitting them in battle against their loved ones (the Fernandez warrior and Rosa).

Carrie kills her vampirized kin while Reinhardt beats Rosa in combat. The heroes then climb several of the castle's towers before confronting Actrise and Death atop the Room of Clocks. With their defeat, the heroes climb the Clock Tower to the Castle Keep.

Gameplay

The North American and PAL versions of the cartridge do not have a built in save feature; all saved games are stored on a memory pack.

The heroes may also need to battle Renon, the Demon Salesman in his true form. This depends upon if thirty thousand gold or more is spent with Renon over the course of the game.
[edit] Difficulty settings

Castlevania has different settings to adjust the challenge posed by the game. In "Easy mode", the player will only be able to play until the end of the Castle Center level, at which time the game will ask them to try "Normal mode" to advance to the subsequent stages. Upon fulfilling certain conditions a 'hard mode' will be unlocked. In this mode enemies take more hits to defeat and subweapons require more jewel points to use (e.g. 2 jewel points for the knife instead of 1).


Position in chronology

Castlevania was present within the series' chronology from its original release in 1999 until 2002, when a timeline published on the official Japanese Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance website omitted it - as well as several other Castlevania games - from the series' continuity. In 2006, series producer Koji Igarashi stated that "These games were taken out of the timeline [...] not because I didn't work on them, but because they were considered by their directors to be side projects in the series". Since the 2002 removal, the events of Castlevania have occupied an ambiguous place in timelines published by Konami of Japan, Konami of America, and various gaming publications. The most recent English language timeline, distributed with preordered versions of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin in North America by Konami of America, includes the 1999 Castlevania but does not describe the game's plot. Some of the events and characters from the prequel/remix Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness which contain a version of Castlevania 64 are referenced in Castlevania Judgment, in the form of the man-wolf Cornell. According to IGA characters from different eras of Castlevania's timeline were brought together by magic to save the timeline from being destroyed.

Plot

Set in the year 1844, the game stars the man-beast Cornell in his quest to prevent his adoptive sister, Ada, from being used as a sacrifice to resurrect Dracula. The game opens as Cornell arrives at his village, which has been burned to the ground by Dracula's minions. He finds Ada's pendant in a doorway and follows her scent to Dracula's castle.

During the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.

Throughout the game, Cornell encounters his rival and fellow man-beast, Ortega. Ortega has allied himself with Dracula to finally beat Cornell in combat, turning into a chimera like creature. They eventually battle near the end of the game, just before Cornell defeats Dracula and saves his sister. He only accomplishes the latter by sacrificing his man-wolf powers. Unbeknownst to the hero, acquiring this power was the true aim of the dark forces, as it was the perfect sacrifice (not Ada, as Cornell had assumed) to resurrect Dracula at his full power.

Development

Legacy of Darkness was a continuation of Konami's first attempt (Castlevania, also published in 1999) to create a 3D Castlevania. It is officially referred to as a "Special Edition" of the original game[citation needed], and more fully realizes the game designers' vision. For example, Cornell was present in early development media and press information for Castlevania, but was ultimately removed before the game's release.

Legacy's primary focus is on a new story (a prequel to Carrie and Reinhardt's adventures) in which Cornell explores new levels, as well as redesigned levels from Castlevania 64. Levels from Castlevania 64 that have not been drastically changed (such as the Villa) are often navigated in a new or novel manner and feature different puzzles. Carrie and Reinhardt's quests are a secondary focus (bonus features), that can only be unlocked after completing both Cornell and Henry's quests. Carrie and Reinhardt's quests lack voice acting, some cutscenes and the original level designs present in Castlevania 64, instead adopting the new designs (from Cornell and Henry's quests). Very minor details have been removed as well; a demonic sound effect used when Death summons giant barracuda through pentagram portals and animation of a female vampire boss in the Villa stage slowly backing away after receiving damage. Their quests also feature new bosses from Henry's quest, such as Medusa and the Queen of the Spider.

In Legacy control of the game's characters, camera, and frame-rate were streamlined. The game also supports the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak add-on, which allows for an option in which textures are displayed in a higher resolution. However, this mode is plagued by frame rate problems. Legacy of Darkness also features several minor additions, such as an alternate costume for Cornell and new alternate costumes for Carrie and Reinhardt (their original costumes from Castlevania 64).

Description

This 3D platform game stars Davy, a blue chameleon, as he travels across six themed worlds: Jungle Land, Ant Land, Bomb Land, Desert Castle, Kids Land, and Ghost Castle. Davy adventures through six worlds. The chameleon's elongated tongue can be used as a weapon, a means to traverse gaps, or as a way to leap onto platforms. Once the tongue is unrolled, it can be guided in any direction using the analog stick. A five-room training area is available to let you practice the unusual controls. The single-player game involves progressing through predominately indoor environments, each culminating in a boss battle, while collecting hearts to replenish health.

Story

The protagonist of the game is a blue chameleon named Davy who, upon following a rabbit (closely resembling Lewis Carroll's White Rabbit) into a magical hole in the ground, finds he has taken on a humanoid form.

The plot involves Davy or one of his friends, Jack, Fred, or Linda, traveling throughout the six lands of the magic portal he enters, in an attempt to find a way back through the portal and back home, following the same rabbit he met before he entered the world.


Gameplay

By pressing the B button, players are able to have their controlled character stick out his or her tongue. Using the analog stick, players are then able to control the movement of the tongue. This enables the player to obtain power-ups from a distance or to swallow enemies. The tongue will extend until it reaches its full length and retracts back into the chameleon's mouth, or until it bumps a wall, which yields the same result. As a basic attack, Davy and his friends, who have the same powers, can stick out their tongue and swallow enemies that stick to it. Once inside their mouth, the Chameleons have the option of spitting the enemies back out of their mouths at other enemies.

In order to jump up to levels of ground that are usually impossible to reach, the characters are able to launch themselves into the air by using their tongues. If used while the chameleon is moving an a particular direction, the jump is given even more altitude, in what is comparable to pole vaulting.

When faced with impassable gaps in the ground, which frequently block the way, the player is usually able to grab a pole on the other side of the pit, allowing him or her to either move across the pit in a set direction. The player may rather choose to move across the pit in a circular motion by swinging around the pole by pressing the A button and the desired direction after grabbing the pole.

Multiplayer

In addition to the single-player game, Chameleon Twist offers a battle option, allowing two to four players the chance to take part in either a Battle Royal or Time Trial event. Battle Royal has you trying to be the last chameleon left standing on a suspended platform, while Time Trial rewards the chameleon that stays on the platform the longest. In the latter event, the chameleon that has fallen off the fewest number of times is considered the winner. Options include four difficulty settings for multiplayer games, adjustable battle lengths, and a choice of four stages for both the Battle Royal and Time Trial modes.

Story

The story of Chameleon Twist 2 takes place after the events in Chameleon Twist. Davy and his friends (Jack, Fred, and Linda) are playing in the forest, still carrying the backpack from his last adventure, when suddenly the rabbit (closely resembling Lewis Carroll's White Rabbit) from before falls down and knocks one of the chameleons into the sky. The chameleon transforms into an enhanced-looking humanoid chameleon and goes on a search for six carrots in six different worlds. The first world is Sky Land where the Mushroom boss is located, the second world is Carnival Land where the big Hamburger boss where is end of the level, the third world is Ice Land where the Walrus boss with spike wheels, the fourth world is Great Edo Land where the Frog of Samurai is usually locate, the fifth world is Toy Land where the giant red robot is shaft especially giant of the boss and locate in the boss stage of end level and Pyramid Land the sixth world and last level of the game, the final boss is Sphinx with the lion head.

Gameplay

The game changed certain aspects of the original, such as the character designs and the switched colors of the main characters. New moves were added such as a parachute that could be deployed to make a slow descent and that could be used in conjunction with the tongue. Moreover, vertical pole swings were added, rather than having only horizontal.

Whenever the player saw the rabbit, he or she could talk to it. The rabbit would ask them if they wanted to go to a practice course, and they could either accept or decline. If they declined, the rabbit would fly away and the player would not be able to visit that bonus course anytime again in the game.

The worlds are much longer than those of the first. However, there is no longer a multiplayer mode.


Graphics and sound

Chameleon Twist 2 has an imaginative dreamworld environments. The textures of the worlds are less detailed, but more colorful.

The music in the game mirrored the first in that it was cheerful, upbeat and fast tempo. Din is the music contributor for this game.

The Japanese version featured the same design for the playable characters from the prequel, while in International versions outside of the Japanese Release, the design has been edited to be more chameleon-like. In Japan, Davy is blue while Jack is green. In the International Versions, Davy is green while Jack is blue; in contrast to the original.

Gameplay

Each of the game's 60 islands has a certain amount of bombs that must be blown up to advance. An island has a single red detonator bomb, which must be grouped alongside other bombs in the level before lighting the detonator bomb, which allows for all the bombs to explode and destroy the island. If the player is either caught in an explosion, or fails to remove all the bombs in the level, they are forced to retry the level from the start.

Reception

Charlie Blast's Territory received mostly mediocre reviews from critics for its flawed control scheme. GameSpot criticized the graphics and the sound of the game, noting, "... this game seems like a generally decent puzzle game in a substandard package."IGN rated the game higher, and recommended it for hardcore puzzle gamers. GamePro also noted the lackluster presentation.

Developer: Takara
Publisher: THQ
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
The Choro Q video games are a series of console games based on Takara's Choro Q toy cars (also known as Penny Racers in English-speaking markets). The games have been localised for Western release under many different names, including Gadget Racers, Penny Racers and Road Trip.

Most of these games were developed by external companies, although they are usually credited to Takara since the developers' name rarely appears outside of the ending credits. Some of these developers include Tamsoft (Choro Q, Choro Q 2 and Choro Q 3), Barnhouse Effect (Shin Combat Choro Q, Choro Q HG and Choro Q HG 4) and E-game (Choro Q Wonderful, Choro Q HG 2 and Choro Q HG 3). Most are auto racing games with extensive opportunities for customisation, often including RPG-style elements such as towns and side-quests.

Overseas releases

Only three games in the series were released outside of Japan prior to 2001 (including the 1984 MSX game by Taito Corporation, which is unrelated to the later Choro Q titles) - Choro Q for the PlayStation (released in Europe only as Penny Racers) and Choro Q 64 for the Nintendo 64 (released in North America and Europe as Penny Racers). However, since 2001 many of the titles have been released in the US and PAL regions as budget titles, by publishers including Conspiracy Entertainment, Midas Interactive Entertainment and Play It!.

Clay Fighter 64 1-3
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1997
Developer: Interplay
Publisher: Interplay
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Like its predecessors ClayFighter and C2 Judgement Clay (both released on the SNES), Clayfighter 63? uses stop motion animation and claymation as opposed to traditional computer animation to produce a unique effect. Its title was a play on the fact that many of the titles for the N64, at the time, had been labeled with the number 64 after the title (Pilotwings 64, Super Mario 64, etc.). It is also a parody of The Naked Gun movie series titles, particularly Naked Gun 33?: The Final Insult.

The arenas in ClayFighter 63? are unique in that each one, with several exceptions, houses multiple rooms; during fights players can punch or kick their opponents into different rooms and the fight will then continue in that room. Originally planned for release on 3DO's M2 console, the game initially had a much darker tone.[citation needed] Also there are 26 different rooms to fight in.

The game itself parodies other fighting games. It uses a 3-level bar for super combos like in Street Fighter Alpha and uses parries like Street Fighter III, and many of the super attacks are noticeably variations of attacks from the Street Fighter series. It also features a combo system similar to Killer Instinct, although it makes fun of the combo names (for example, "Itty Bitty Combo", or "Triple Brown Betty Combo", even as high as a 234 hit combo, which is known as "Insane Combo"). It also parodies Mortal Kombat's fatalities with silly sequences (they are called Claytalities). Michael Buffer, the announcer, begins each match with a variation of his famous catch phrase: "Let's get ready to crumble!", a play on "Let's get ready to rumble". During battle you can use many different attacks which have their own strengths and weaknesses.


Characters

There are 12 bizarre fighters in ClayFighter 63?, some from previous games in the series, but most debuting in this game. The first nine are available for play immediately, and the latter three are hidden characters (shown below) that can be unlocked with cheat codes. Nevertheless, all appeared in the re-release of the game, ClayFighter 63?: Sculptor's Cut.

    Bad Mr. Frosty The Killer Snowman (voiced by Jim Cummings)

Once again reformed, Bad Mr. Frosty is a grouchy snowman who seeks to halt Dr. Kiln's sinister plot and reclaim the North Pole from Sumo Santa. Frosty battles by transforming his frozen body in various ways, creating snow balls, ice picks, and other such weapons. Frosty tends to punch and kick his opponents by leeringly growling "Call me Daddy!". He's one of the few characters to appear in all three games in the series, though his appearance has changed greatly in each game. He appears to be a demonic version of Frosty the Snowman.

    Blob (voiced by Frank Welker)

An amorphous green blob with a dopey grin, the Blob may not look like a skilled fighter at first glance. In actuality, Blob is a master of morphing, transforming his body into cannons, sledgehammers, boxing gloves, and many other weapons. Blob also has an appetite for living clay, and thinks nothing of gobbling up a downed opponent for a quick snack. Blob has also been in all three games in the series. In previous games, the Blob had a high-pitched voice and a sadistic grin, but for this outing he's been given a Quasimodo-like voice and a dopey expression.

    Bonker (voiced by Rob Paulsen)

A former children's entertainer, Bonker went insane years ago and now seeks revenge on anybody who laughed at him in his life. With a perpetual scowl on his face and a somber tone of voice, Bonker's homicidal mania belies his flamboyant dress and makeup. Attacking with cream pies, mallets and a portable cannon, Bonker has many ways to make his enemies suffer. He's a returning character from the first game, with a completely different design: the original Bonker had a manic grin and a cheerfully goofy voice.

    Kung Pow (voiced by Jess Harnell)

Rather resembling a bucktoothed Bruce Lee, Kung Pow is a Chinese chef who is also skilled in the martial arts. He wears a white gi, and his dialogue is peppered with bland tidbits of dubious "oriental" wisdom. Most of Kung Pow's attacks are named after Chinese food (like Egg foo young, chop suey, etc.), and he uses utensils such as chopsticks, woks and meat cleavers as weapons. His name is a reference to Kung Pao chicken.

    Houngan (voiced by Jim Cummings)

An evil Jamaican witch doctor and master of voodoo, Happy Harry Houngan has a sinister set of abilities to aid his quest of conquering the world with his black magic. Houngan's main weapon is his rubber chicken, which he has transformed into a zombie. Houngan also sports a juju staff, and a wooden tiki mask to use as a bludgeon (or a snowboard). Some of his attacks cause rotting zombie hands to reach out of the ground and grab his opponent. When he enters the Battle Stage he then rotates his head around which is parodying The Exorcist.

    T-Hoppy The Killer Rabbit (voiced by Charlie Adler)

A cyborg rabbit, T-Hoppy was created as a living weapon by Doctor Kiln (by combining an unexplainably disfigured Hoppy from Clayfighter 2 with mechanical implants) until he rebelled against his creator. Now T-Hoppy fights to destroy Kiln and regain peace of mind. In addition to great physical strength and cybernetic implants, T-Hoppy is also an accomplished stage magician. In ClayFighter 2, Hoppy had an Austrian accent, poking fun at Arnold Schwarzenegger (Even though he didn't have his implants at the time), and the T in his name refers to Arnold's role as The Terminator, but Adler chose to go with a generic drill sergeant-style voice to fit his new design. Hoppy is also the only new character from C2 Judgement Clay to return, all of the other 4 were cut.

    Taffy (voiced by Tress MacNeille)

A former circus freak and partner of Bonker, Taffy is a bizarre creature made entirely out of, fittingly enough, taffy. This gives him incredible flexibility and agility. Taffy also carries gumballs as throwing weapons and carries a pair of six-shooters. He frequently imitates Curly Howard of The Three Stooges, especially Moe's "Oh, a wise guy, eh?" line. This vocal similarity was more noticeable in the original Clayfighter, where Taffy originated.

    Earthworm Jim (voiced by Dan Castellaneta)

The mightiest worm in all creation, Earthworm Jim is vacationing on Claymodo Island when he hears of Doctor Kiln's mad scheme. Never one to let evil have its way, Jim springs into action, showcasing all the head-whipping, raygun-blasting, cow-dropping action his fans love. He's a guest character from his own series of games and Dan Castellaneta reprises his role from the cartoon series. In Sculptor's Cut, Jim was only playable as a secret character.

    Ickybod Clay (voiced by Frank Welker)

Ickybod Clay is a withered ghoul with a mushy Jack-o'-lantern for a head. Icky resides in his own haunted mansion, although his squeaky voice and rather geeky personality do not make him the terrifying fiend he aspires to be. Among his many attacks, he can throw his own head as a weapon, has a parody shoryuuken called the Boo-Hoo Ken, and can teleport. He also appeared in the original ClayFighter, but with a more whispery and creepy voice. His name is a parody of Ichabod Crane.


Locked characters

    Sumo Santa (voiced by Jim Cummings)

An evil duplicate of Santa Claus (in fact, the game implies that he is Santa Claus) clad in little more than a loincloth. Megalomaniacal Sumo Santa has conquered the North Pole as his own, and only Frosty stands in his way. Grotesquely obese but surprisingly agile, Sumo Santa enjoys using his ponderous girth to smash the competition flat.

    Dr. Kiln (voiced by Charles Adler)

Dr. Generic Kiln is the main villain of the piece. After being indirectly responsible for the chaos in Clayfighter 2 (he's mentioned in the Clayfighter 2 manual, but doesn't appear in the game itself), his latest scheme is to transform the entire world into clay, which he can then mold into whatever he wishes. After accidentally dipping his hand into the giant clay meteor, Dr. Kiln was forced to amputate his hand, which he replaced with a mechanical prosthetic. This new hand can transform into a propeller, a machine gun, a chainsaw, jumper cables, a scalpel, and other dangerous weapons. Meanwhile, his lost hand grew, gained sentience, and became High Five, a hidden character in Sculptor's Cut. With his opaque eyeglasses, hunched back and thick Germanic accent, Dr. Kiln is very much the consummate mad scientist.

    Boogerman (voiced by Dan Castellaneta)

Another hero from previous Interplay games, Boogerman joins the fracas to save the day and show up his old rival Earthworm Jim. Boogerman uses bodily emissions such as mucus, belches, and explosive flatulence against his foes. He can also summon a barrage of falling toilets.

    ClayFighter 63? is something of a reunion of voice actors who worked on the animated series Animaniacs:[citation needed]
        Jim Cummings (Some narration and character voices)
        Jess Harnell (Wakko Warner)
        Tress MacNeille (Dot Warner, Hello Nurse, Marita Hippo)
        Rob Paulsen (Yakko Warner, Pinky, Dr. Scratchansniff)
        Frank Welker (Ralph the Guard, Mr. Plotz, Buttons, Runt, Flavio Hippo, Chicken Boo)



Trivia

    Lockjaw Pooch is featured on the box art for the game even though he does not appear until "ClayFighter 63?: Sculptor's Cut."

Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut

Developer: Interplay
Publisher: Interplay
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
ClayFighter 63? suffered many delays and was released almost a year after it had previously been scheduled. Nintendo Power even ran a cover story and review of the game in the spring of 1997, expecting an imminent release. In the end, the game was released in a fairly rushed state, with several previously-promised features being cut due to time restraints.

As a result, Interplay later updated ClayFighter 63? with ClayFighter 63?: Sculptor's Cut, which was released as a Blockbuster Video rental exclusive and contains a number of characters that had missed the deadline for the original release. In doing so, they also removed the Killer Instinct-like combo system, and while all the characters from 63? remained, Interplay removed many of the original characters' special and super attacks (presumably due to memory limitations). The game also included an elaborate introductory sequence with an original song.

The Sculptor's Cut version of the game is one of the rarest North American Nintendo 64 games. Because it was released as a Blockbuster rental deal and got little distribution, boxed copies are extremely rare. The game has sold on Ebay for up to $275, with loose copies starting at $45, making it one of the most expensive N64 games.

Characters exclusive to the Sculptor's Cut:

    Lady Liberty (voiced by Tress MacNeille)

The Statue of Liberty transformed by Dr. Kiln into a living clay creature. Like T-Hoppy, Lady Liberty turned on her creator and seeks to destroy him. Lady Liberty's main weapon is her famous torch, which can be used as a flamethrower.

    High Five (voiced by Tress MacNeille)

Dr. Kiln's severed hand, mutated by chemicals and transformed into a sentient being. High Five has a deep resentment for his former host, and despite his physical limitations, is a skilled "hand-to-hand combatant". In terms of gameplay, High Five appears to be unfinished, since he has no ducking Brutal Kick, only one super attack, and no Claytalities.

    Lockjaw Pooch (voiced by Frank Welker)

Although marked as killed in the production of the original Clayfighter 63? ("This animal was severely injured during the making of this game"), Lockjaw returns to ravage the competition in the Sculptor's Cut. A vicious junkyard dog granted sentience by Dr. Kiln's experiments, the ever-loyal Lockjaw puts his powerful fangs to good use in battle.

    Zappa Yow Yow Boyz (voiced by Frank Welker)

Three little pygmy brothers who are the bane of Houngan's existence. Although short and squat, the Boyz are a force to be reckoned with when they climb onto each other's shoulders for battle, as well as summoning their pet goat. The Boyz are cannibalistic, and enjoy tossing defeated opponents into a boiling kettle for dinner.

In addition, there is a character designed for both versions of the game but was left out: Hobo Cop (a play on RoboCop). Hobo Cop was a homeless drunk who considered himself a vigilante, staggering into battle with armor made from trash cans. The character was ultimately decreed as too offensive and was disposed of.

Release Year: 1999
Developer: Looking Glass Studios
Publisher: Virgin Interactive
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Command Conquer
_________________________
*
Gameplay

One of the quintessential titles of the modern real time strategy genre, Command & Conquer's gameplay mechanics will typically require the player to construct a base and then acquire a flow of resources, in order to fund the ongoing production of various forces to assault and conquer the opponent's base. Command & Conquer features around 50 different units and structures. Virtually every type of structure in the game acts as a tech tree node, and additional units, structures and special abilities become available to the player as new structures are built and placed. Access to advanced units and abilities can be temporarily blocked if the required structures are destroyed, or if they are not being provided with adequate power by the supporting "power plant" structures.

All structures available to the player are built on-site at a "construction yard" building, which can either be already deployed on the battlefield as the mission starts or begin as a large-sized mobile construction vehicle ("MCV"), which is capable of deploying itself into an aforementioned construction yard at a suitable location of the player's choice. As a structure is being constructed, resources will steadily be deducted from the player's credits counter until construction is finished. When the construction yard has finished building the new structure, the player can select a spot next to a pre-existing structure in order to place it, where the prefabricated building will rapidly begin unfolding in a distinctive manner. Base defense is provided by specialized defensive structures, as well as fortification in the form of sandbags, wire fences and concrete walls. Later on in the game, the player can build lethal defensive structures like guard towers with machine guns or rockets, gun turrets, or the iconic "Obelisk of Light" of the Brotherhood of Nod.

While the two sides largely mirror each other in regards to tech trees and unit types, each has a distinct strategic preference. GDI units are intended to be sturdy and are often more powerful than their Nod counterparts, at the cost of being more expensive and having slower movement. GDI forces also have access to air and naval support. Stationary defenses include the guard tower and missile armed advanced guard tower which can engage ground and air targets. Conversely, Nod's units are cheap and fast, at the cost of withstanding less punishment. Nod forces are made to avoid direct engagement as much as possible, relying on hit-and-run tactics, active camouflage and guerrilla warfare to gain the advantage. Nod also has access to limited air support and naval support. Stationary defenses include the anti-tank gun turret, the Obelisk of Light laser guard towers and the surface to air missile (SAM) site.

Tiberium, the game's sole resource (except for the occasional money crate), is acquired by specialized "harvester" units which bring their cargo to a "refinery" structure and which in turn will convert the crystals into usable resources, expressed as credits. The Tiberium itself requires storage space in the form of "refineries" and, in the case of excess, "storage silo" facilities. Deposits of Tiberium are able to slowly regenerate and proliferate on the battlefield if not depleted beforehand, and can also cause nearby plant life to mutate itself into so-called "Blossom Trees". Blossom Trees seed Tiberium spores to their surroundings, and once one or several are present on the battlefield Tiberium deposits will regenerate themselves on the map indefinitely.




On N64;

The Nintendo 64 version updated certain graphical elements to 3D, though the terrain texture remained the same. The game offered an optional high-resolution 640ï¿½480 mode and a MIDI rendition of the PC version's soundtrack. The videos were removed due to cartridge storage constraints, and replaced with either static images accompanied by the cutscenes' audio tracks, or with cutscenes converted to real-time 3D scenes. This release did not include The Covert Operations, but did have four new missions which were called Special Ops.

Conker's Bad Fur Day
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Action > Platformer
Release Year: 2001
Developer: Rare
Publisher: Rare
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform game where the player controls Conker the Squirrel through several levels. The game also features an overworld in which the player can transition from one level to another, although many of which are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore in order to encounter tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help several characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.

Conker's abilities are far simpler than those of previous Rare platformers, such as Banjo-Kazooie or Donkey Kong 64. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. Besides this, he also has few other physical abilities. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, climb ladders or ropes, and is strong enough to push heavy objects. To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of "Anti-Gravity" Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. Additionally, the game employs "context sensitive" pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the "B" button atop them. For instance, in the beginning of the game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil in order to slam into the ground, and some are also used to pull out his shotgun, to activate his throwing knives, slingshot and so on.


Plot

The story opens with a prologue, spoofing the opening scene of A Clockwork Orange, where Conker tells the player that he is now "king of all the land", and begins to tell the story of the game. Purcell's "Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary" plays during this sequence.

The morning after a night of binge drinking with his friends, Conker awakes to find himself lost in an unfamiliar land with a terrible hangover. Having no other choice, he begins a long journey with the goal of returning home to his girlfriend, Berri. Meanwhile, the Panther King, ruler of the land that Conker is lost in, finds that his throne's side table is missing one of its legs when he accidentally spills his milk because of it. Not knowing what to do about this problem, he has a meeting with Professor Von Kriplespac, a legless mad scientist weasel that he keeps as a right-hand servant. Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg for his table and, heeding this advice, the Panther King orders his minions to search for one and capture it. In the meantime, Kriplespac plots to assassinate the king and escape.[1]

As Conker searches for his way home, he finds himself embroiled in a series of increasingly absurd and oftentimes dangerous situations, including having to recover a bee hive from some enormous wasps, confronting a giant opera-singing pile of feces, being turned into a bat by a vampire, and even getting drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a Nazi-like race of teddy bears simply known as the "Tediz". However, Conker keeps managing to find wads of cash scattered throughout the land, and in his desire to find them all, he is sidetracked from his ultimate goal of returning home. While this is occurring, Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, sends one of his henchmen to abduct Berri from her home, with the intention of using her as an exotic dancer for his nightclub.

In the final chapter of the game, Berri and Conker are enlisted by Don Weaso to rob a bank. When they get into the vault, they find many wads of cash, enough to make them both millionaires. Conker is overwhelmed with excitement at this development; however, the Panther King, Weaso and Kriplespac suddenly appear before Conker and Berri, revealing that the entire bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the king and Don Weaso in order to capture Conker. Hearing this, Berri defiantly stands up to them in defense of Conker, but Don Weaso shortly shoots her to death with a Thompson. Just as all hope seems lost for Conker, a Xenomorph bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. In the ensuing confusion, Don Weaso sneaks off and escapes unseen. Kriplespac reveals that the alien is one of his creations, and that he had planned all along to use this opportunity to kill the king and escape, expressing hatred for the castle's lack of technology. On that note, he activates the vault's machinery, revealing it to be a spaceship that immediately launches into low orbit. Naming the alien "Heinrich", he instructs it to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. However, Conker thinks fast and pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac into the vacuum of space. Berri's body is sucked into space as well.

Using an armored robotic suit found in the vault, Conker throws the xenomorph out of the airlock. However, it returns and lunges at him again, and as it does so, the entire game suddenly locks up. Exiting the suit, Conker expresses disbelief at the fact that Rare apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. A programmer immediately responds to him, communicating to Conker with a command line. Entering the game's debug mode, Conker asks the programmer to spawn a selection of weapons (a la The Matrix), from which he draws a katana, and then asks the programmer to transport them to the Panther King's throne room and unfreeze the game. He then decapitates Heinrich, and is crowned the new king of the land by the characters who shortly rush into the room. However, Conker states that he doesn't really want to be king because he remembers that he's supposed to go home, and then comes to the grim realization that Berri is still dead. He attempts to ask the programmers to bring her back to life, but realizes that they have already left.

Conker then speaks to the player in a closing monologue, in which he discusses what it means to appreciate what one already has instead of being overcome with desire and envy for superficially better circumstances, stating that "the grass is always greener, and you don't really know what it is you have until it's gone." After the credits, Conker returns to the pub seen at the beginning of the game, alone and completely miserable. After drowning his sorrows in scotch whisky, Conker drunkenly stumbles off into the stormy night once again, this time walking in the direction opposite from the one he took previously. His fate, this time, remains unknown.

Rare originally wanted a much darker ending that involved Conker walking up to a mirror in the pub, bursting into tears, pulling out a gun and aiming it at his head. The screen would fade out, followed by the sound of a gunshot, indicating that Conker had committed suicide. This ending was dumped because "It didn't spot much for a sequel." However, when Chris Seavor was asked about a new Conker game, he said it would focus entirely on the SHC/Tediz war, and Conker would be killed in the first scene.

Cancelled sequel

After the release of Conker's Bad Fur Day, Rare began production on a new Conker game initially named Conker's Other Bad Day, but may have been changed to incorporate a subtitle, 'Getting Medieval'.[17] In 2002, Microsoft purchased Rare from Nintendo, so instead of finishing and releasing the game, Rare remade Conker's Bad Fur Day for the Xbox, naming it, Conker: Live & Reloaded. On September 16, 2008 it was announced that Microsoft cancelled the game Rare was working on, and in a later interview, some of Rare's staff members hinted at what might have been. Online petitions are set up to try and get the sequel created. Chris Seavor from Rare had this to say about the sequel. “We actually started on a direct sequel which was going to be called ‘Conker’s Other Bad Day‘ which dealt with Conker’s somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King. He spends all the treasury money on beer, parties and hookers. Thrown into prison, Conker is faced with the prospect of execution and the game starts with his escape, ball and chain attached, from the Castles highest tower.”.

Cruis'n USA was released for the Arcade in 1994, then later for the Nintendo 64 on December 3, 1996. This game was developed by Midway Games and published by Nintendo. The race starts in San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and ends at the White House in Washington, D.C. The objective in this game is to outrun nine different cars in fourteen different levels. In the Nintendo 64 version, the first time you play all the levels are locked except for the U.S. Route 101. Along the way you can race in different difficulties to unlock new paint jobs and upgrades. The Nintendo 64 version can save different accounts by using the Game Pak. Both the Arcade and Nintendo 64 versions allow two players to race on each course or cruise the U.S.A.

The development for the Nintendo 64 version of Cruis'n USA was announced in 1995. Nintendo promised the game would look and act the same as the arcade version by using Ultra 64 technology. Williams got the Cruis'n USA license to port the game over to the Nintendo 64, but the game was too advanced for the Nintendo 64 hardware due to the reality engine that Midway Games used. Therefore, due to hardware they had to downgrade most of the graphics in order to get the game over to the Nintendo 64. In 1996, Cruis'n USA was announced to be a launched title for the Nintendo 64. However, the game got delayed before the Nintendo 64 was released due to the censorship problems that game had. During the last couple of months of development, people sent letters or emails about the censorship. This game was re-released in 1998 as the part of Nintendo's Player's Choice series. In 2008 the game was re-released on Wii's Virtual Console.

Cruis'n World is the 1996 sequel to the 1994 arcade racer Cruis'n USA. As the title implies, Cruis'n World allows players to race on various tracks around the world. The game also features more cars than Cruis'n USA. This game introduced stunts to the Cruis'n series. They served to dodge obstacles, take close curves and so. If the stunt makes the vehicle fly in the air, the game gives the player extra seconds of time. The game also uses small rocket boosts to speed up.

The game was later released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, being the best received of the Cruis'n ports.

Development

The development of the Nintendo 64 version started in 1996 after the development of the Nintendo 64 version of Cruis'n USA. Eugene Jarvis has even admitted that the Cruis'n USA port wasn't good, so they promised the game to be an arcade perfect port. Eurocom took the Cruis'n license and decided to spend more time on the game than in Cruis'n USA. In early 1997, Nintendo had announced that Cruis'n World would be coming to the Nintendo 64 in the fall, but the game was silently delayed until 1998.

Arcade and Nintendo 64 differences

    In the arcade version, many voice clips were present in certain stages, explaining about them. In the Nintendo 64 version, they were removed for unknown reasons.

    In the arcade version, the animals explode into bloody chunks when the player hits them, while on the N64 version, the player passes right through them or they run across the road early enough so the player does not hit them. This was probably done to avoid the game getting a teen rating (because at that point, the E10+ rating didn't exist).

    The Nintendo 64 version gives the player the ability to race in a tournament mode, save data back to the ROM cartridge, and give the car custom boosts ("Power Levels") and paint jobs. The Nintendo 64 version also features split-screen multiplayer.

    The Nintendo 64 version is Rumble Pack-compatible, while the steering wheel provides resistance on the arcade version when the player collides with something.

    In the arcade version, at the start of the race, a woman appears on the screen and waves the checkered flag and says "READY...SET...GO!!" and then goes offscreen. In the Nintendo 64 version, there's an option in the Options menu that toggles this feature.

    In the song, "Asia Minor" (originally known as "Noble Sama") that was used on the stages Japan and China, the sound of the tubular bells was removed.

    The aracde version features original Cruis'n USA sounds. On the N64 version, these sounds were replaced.

Custom Robo
Platform: Nintendo 64
Region: Japan
Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1996
Developer: NOISE
Publisher: Nintendo
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Custom Robo takes place in a collect-customize-and-battle style RPG genre similar to games such as Robotrek or Front Mission, but with frantic action battles in confined 3D arenas (2D arenas in Custom Robo GX), similar to Virtual On. In each game's story mode, players slip into the role of a nameable young boy who has just had a dream about Custom Robos. After waking up, he walks up to his parents while they talk, and proceed to give him his first Custom Robo and some parts for battling. A friend then comes by to take the protagonist to where Custom Robo events are held. In each game, the first Custom Robo players obtain is always a model of the Ray series. The goal for players is to improve their skills and collect different Custom Robos in order to defeat everyone, including champion Custom Robo users.

The main objective of the game is to finish the storyline by collecting every Custom Robo and battle part, while winning every battle that moves players along through the story arc. In Custom Robo battles, the object is to reduce the opponent's hit points from 1000 to 0 by using different Custom Robos, guns, bombs, pods, and dash attacks. Custom Robos are arranged in groups that are similar to their abilities. The endurance bar is located above the player's hitbox; once it runs out, the Custom Robo gets "downed" which means that it stays fallen for a couple seconds. After the Robo gets up, it goes into "rebirth" mode, where it stays invincible for about 3 seconds. If players repeatedly lose the same battle, the game will offer the option of reducing the opponent's initial health, in order to make the battle easier. If players continue to lose several times, the degree of handicap offered increases up to 75%, giving the opponent a starting HP of 250, rather than 1000.

The first title of the Custom Robo series. It is also the first and only title of the series released for the iQue Player in China.

Animal Crossing, known as Dobutsu no Mori (???????, lit. "Animal Forest") in Japan, is a life simulation video game developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan for the Nintendo 64 on April 14, 1999. The game was not released for the N64 outside Japan. It was ported to the Nintendo GameCube in Japan on December 14, 2001; North America on September 15, 2002; Australia on October 17, 2003; and Europe on September 24, 2002. The Japanese GameCube version lacks e-Reader support, a feature found in the North American and Australian versions. A version of Animal Crossing was released in Japan with e-Reader support on June 27, 2003. A sequel, Animal Crossing: Wild World, was released on the Nintendo DS. Another sequel Animal Crossing: City Folk, was released on the Nintendo Wii. The first planned sequel, Animal Crossing 2, was to be released on the Nintendo Gamecube but was cancelled.\

Animal Crossing is a social simulator that has been dubbed a "communication game" by Nintendo.[citation needed] It is open-ended, and the player's character can live a separate life with little preset plot or mandatory tasks. Players assume the role of a new resident to the town. The gender and looks of the character depend on answers given to a cat named Rover on the train that the character takes to the town. There are also tasks that players can complete and goals they can achieve. The game is played in real-time-observing days, weeks, months and years using the GameCube's internal clock. Many real-life events and holidays span the year, including Independence Day, Halloween, the Harvest Festival (Thanksgiving), and Toy Day (Christmas). Other, regular activities such as fishing tournaments and early-morning fitness classes also occur. When players stop playing, they can talk to their Gyroid, a creature next to their house, to save. If the player turns off the game or resets the GameCube without saving first, a mole called Resetti appears in front of the player's house the next time they play to scold them for resetting; what they achieved the time before is lost but everything else is kept.

One of the main goals of the game, given to the player during the game's opening cut scenes, is to increase the size of the player's character's house. This house is the repository for furniture and other items acquired during the course of the game. It can be customized in several ways, such as roof color, furniture, music, wallpaper and flooring. These customizations are judged by the Happy Room Academy (HRA) every Sunday. Players are given the choice to receive HRA letters at the start of the game, however you are ultimately forced to.

Tom Nook, a tanuki in the Japanese version and a raccoon in the American and European versions, runs the local store. At the beginning of the game, he gives the player their first house with a mortgage of 19,800 Bells (the in-game currency). On paying the debt, part of which is done through a part-time job with Nook, the house is expanded, prompting another debt from Nook. The house is expanded several times during the course of the game.

The Animal Crossing village initially contains six villagers, and more move in or out depending on the player's actions. All villagers are animals and each has a home that the player can visit. There are many possible interactions between the player and the villagers, including talking, trading items, completing tasks, writing letters, and, in Doubutsu No Mori e+, buying medicine for when they get sick. Villagers also interact with each other.

Daikatana
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Shooter > First Person
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Kemco
Publisher: Kemco
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: John Romero's Daikatana
_________________________
*
Plot

Daikatana takes place during the year 2455 AD, in a world suffering from a major pandemic caused by a man named Kage Mishima. Through the use of a magical sword called the Daikatana, Mishima travelled back in time and prevented the disease from being cured, allowing him to take control of the world. The protagonist takes the form of a martial arts instructor named Hiro Miyamoto. Hiro, along with minor characters "Superfly Johnson" and Mikiko Ebihara, attempts to recover the Daikatana, travelling to an ancient Greece, medieval Norway, near future Los Angeles and futuristic Tokyo in the process.

Gameplay

Daikatana is composed of twenty-four levels divided into four episodes. The number of maps per level varies, but is generally about three. Each episode represents a different location and time period: futuristic Japan, ancient Greece, the Dark Ages in Norway and near-future San Francisco. Gameplay tends towards fast-paced combat, although an attempt at introducing problem-solving elements was also included.

One element that Daikatana stressed was the important role of the protagonist's two "sidekicks". The death of these sidekicks resulted in the failure of the mission, and their assistance was sometimes required for the completion of puzzles. Due to poor AI implementation, the sidekicks, who were one of the game's selling points, became a focus of criticism



Nintendo 64 version

The Nintendo 64 version of Daikatana has received particularly harsh criticism. Since it was rushed through development (it was released about 3 months after the PC version), significant concessions were made, and many of the flaws of the PC version were retained.

For one, the quality of the graphics was significantly lowered. In order to keep the frame-rate up, large amounts of fog were added to certain levels, particularly in Greece. The graphics were also blurred tremendously, possibly to hide low resolution textures. The level of blurriness increases yet further in the multiplayer mode as well, making it nearly unplayable.

The characters Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara were completely removed from gameplay, yet they were retained in all of the cut scenes.

The Daikatana sword of the title cannot, in this version, actually be used as a weapon.

Dark Rift
Platform: Nintendo 64

Genre: VS Fighter
Release Year: 1998
Developer: Kronos Digital Entertainment
Publisher: Vic Tokai
Players: 1 or 2
Alternate Title: Space Dynamites

Description

Dark Rift delivers hyper-active 3D fighting with a sci-fi theme! Compete against eight exotic and powerful characters and two very large bosses. Motion captured character animations enhance the realism. The arsenal includes multiple-hit combos, back-crunching grabs, juggles, projectiles, and punishing special moves. Tune into individual character stereo sound tracking. Fight in Tournament, 2-Player or Training modes.


Dark Rift (Space Dynamites in Japan) is a 3D fighting game for the N64, notable for being the first N64 game to use 60frame/s, as well as being N64's first native fighting game. It is also unusual among fighting games in that fights go for a default three-out-of-five rounds, as opposed to the more conventional two-out-of-three.

It was originally conceived as Criticom II, and is the second of three fighting games developed by Kronos Digital, falling between Criticom and Cardinal Syn. These three games have been referred to as the "Trilogy of Terror", due to their rather uniform low-standing with critics.

Setting

Dark Rift takes place far in the future, sometime after the events of Criticom. Gameplay spans three dimensions: the Neutral Dimension (where Earth is located), the Dark Dimension (home to demons), and the Light Dimension (home to energy beings). Although the creatures of the Dark Dimension are demonic, there is no indication that the inhabitants of the Light Dimension have any angelic qualities.

Plot

The crystal (the acquisition of which is the main motivation of the characters of Criticom) turns out to be the Core Prime Element of a Master Key, one which holds the power to all the secrets in the universe. The Master Key was found eons ago lodged in a spatial tear. When it was retrieved it burst into three pieces, sending two pieces into alternate dimensions, and widening the tear into the game's namesake Dark Rift.

While it is known that the Demon Lord Demitron (of the Dark Dimension) holds the Dark Prime Element, and Criticom's Sonork (of the Neutral Dimension) holds the Core Prime Element, a tournament is being held in order to lure the unknown holder of the Light Prime Element (presumably from the Light Dimension) out of hiding. Sonork is using his own Core Prime Element as the grand prize.

Densha de Go! 64 (???GO!64 Go by Train 64?) is a train driving simulation game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan on July 30, 1999. Densha de Go! is the only game that works the special N64 version, train driving controller which simulates actual train controls, and one of two games that uses Nintendo 64's "Voice Recognition Unit" or as it is known in Japan the VRS. Like Hey You, Pikachu! it was sold with (Engineer's Pak) or without a microphone that was used to announce train stations to passengers, using the Nintendo 64's "Voice Recognition Unit" or as it is known in Japan the VRS. It is part of the Taito Densha de Go! series.

Playability

There are 7 main lines, with 13 vehicles, on 16 missions. The Hokuhoku Line, Akita Shinkansen Line, Ou Main Line, Tazawako Line, Keihin-Tohoku Line, Yamanote Line, and the Tokaido Main Line.

New to N64[3] is a "Beginner Mode" which allows 999 seconds for the player to complete either the Training Course, or Practice Course. The player is given an allotted amount of time to bring their train into the next station as well as a fixed time that the train was expected to arrive. If the player goes around curves to fast, stops suddenly or encores other such dangers of train operation a few seconds is taken way from the remaining time they have to complete their task.

Densha de Go! 64, Controller

As with most Densha de Go! games this version has a special controller this time for the N64 version which needs to be plugged into controller outlet 3, while the voice mic was inserted into controller outlet 4, and a standard controller in outlet 1[4]. It consists of a switch on the left that goes up and down, controlling the trains speed, all five of its drive speeds and Neutral. The handle on the right controls the breaking speeds 1-8, Emergency brake, and doors opening. Between these two levers is a depression that a person could place a pocket watch or stop watch (not included but designed to look more realistic) to keep the time as they drive. There are five buttons, A, B and C, a start and select button, the select button acting as the Z button to show distance to the next stop, in some game variations

Destruction Derby 64 (DD64) is the Nintendo 64 version of the PlayStation game series Destruction Derby,which is based on the real-life sport of demolition derby, with some differences.

Graphically and technically, the game was considered by some people[who?] as better than its PlayStation counterpart, with more cars available, brighter and better graphics and better recreation of crash damage, which included the hoods and trunks of cars flying off in hard collisions.

The cars that the player starts out with are rather basic generic saloons which have been painted up for racing and smashing. As the player progresses through the various championships they are awarded certain bonus vehicles, such as a black Hot Rod with flames and a blue Ford Mustang GT hybrid called the 'Blue Demon'.

The tracks are varied, from the traditional demolition derby arenas to the circuit races such as 'Destruction Junction' and are reasonably detailed in comparison with the PlayStation version, although the texture detail suffers due to the Nintendo 64's smaller texture memory.

Multiplayer has split screen for up to four players. The arenas that can't be played in single-player 'arcade' mode are available in multiplayer once they are unlocked in the championships.

Cars

There are 24 cars in all. The player starts out with 12, but as well as the cars that are gradually unlocked there are 12 secret cars that you earn by doing championship mode and time trials. The cars in the game are left generic and have no manufacturer branding; possibly due to missing licensing agreements with the automobile manufacturers. These cars include:

    Baja Buggy: A blue and yellow car, which looks like a Volkswagen Beetle.
    Low Rider: Purple low rider with blue hood design, which looks very much like a 1967 Chevy Impala.
    Woody Wagon: Green wagon with wood panels.
    Pickup: Cloud and gold color. Looks like a Chevrolet S-10.
    Taxicab: Yellow taxi with checkered pattern.
    Blue Demon: Ford Mustang GT. Light blue with a blue stripe through the middle.
    Ragtop: Red car with white stripes. Similar to a Corvette.
    Hot Rod: Black Hot Rod with flames.
    Ambulance: White with red stripes.
    Hatchback: Similar to a AMC Gremlin. Green with a dark green stripe.
    Street Rocket: Light blue with turquoise front.
    Police Car: Grey with white doors.


Development

The development of this game was done by Intermetrics Entertainment Software, LLC after Intermetric's acquisition of Looking Glass Studios (see Looking Glass Studios for history). The development was done in Redmond, WA, Intermetrics' studios.

Plot

Timber the Tiger's parents go on vacation and leave their son in charge of the island they live on, leaving him and his friends to race for fun. Their enjoyment is derailed when an evil, intergalactic, pig wizard named Wizpig arrives at peaceful Timber's Island and attempts to take over after he conquered his own planet's racetracks. He turns the four island's guardians: Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon into his henchmen. The only solution available to the island's inhabitants is to defeat Wizpig in an elaborate series of races that involves cars, hovercrafts, and airplanes. Drumstick, the best racer on the island, failed this challenge and was transformed into a frog by Wizpig's black magic. Timber recruits a team of 7 racers: Diddy Kong, the first recruit; Conker (Dixie Kong on DS) and Banjo (Tiny Kong on DS), recruited by Diddy; Krunch, Diddy's enemy who follows after him; and Tiptup, Pipsy, and Bumper, inhabitants of Timber's island. They eventually complete all of Wizpig's challenges and confront Wizpig himself to a race and defeat him. Shortly afterwards, Wizpig leaves for his home planet, Future Fun Land. Fearing that Wizpig would again attempt to invade Timber's Island, the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge. When Wizpig loses the second race, the rocket he rides on malfunctions and blasts him to the moon, and peace returns to Timber Island for good. However, that peace may be short lived, as it is shown in a small scene that shows Wizpig's spaceship flying through the sky. Wizpig is then heard laughing, indicating that he survived.

Gameplay

Each world contains several race tracks, an unlockable battle stage and a race against a boss character. Depending on the race track, players may have a choice of using a car, hovercraft or plane; this choice is restricted on some tracks. Each race track contains Zipper devices that give a short-term speed boost to racers that cross them, and balloons of various colours that provide powerups to racers.

If the player beats Wizpig in Future Fun Land and obtains the amulet pieces and gets all of the gold medals, the player will be able to play in a mode called Adventure 2. In this mode, all of the balloons are silver and the tracks are flipped from left to right. Along with the much sharper difficulty curve, the silver coins are also placed in different locations in each track, often in harder to reach places.


Vehicles

There are three different vehicles in the game. The car and/or plane are not used for some tracks.

    Car - The Car is the standard vehicle of the game. The car cannot be used in all tracks.
    Hovercraft - The Hovercraft is a vehicle used to travel over water and land. Used in all tracks.
    Plane - The Plane is used to fly. It can turn at very sharp angles and is faster than the other two vehicles.

Characters

The playable characters are:

    Diddy Kong
    Banjo (N64 version only)
    Conker (N64 version only)
    Krunch
    Tiptup
    Timber
    Bumper
    Pipsy
    Dixie Kong (DS version only)
    Tiny Kong (DS version only)
    Drumstick (Unlockable)
    T.T. (Unlockable)
    Taj the Genie (Unlockable) (DS version only)
    Wizpig (Unlockable) (DS version only)


Conker and Banjo went on to star in other games (Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo-Kazooie respectively, with the former drastically changing the direction of the star character). Tiptup has a cameo in both Banjo's game and its sequel.

Plot

Goin' Quackers begins with Donald Duck, Gladstone Gander, and Gyro Gearloose watching television reporter Daisy Duck discovering the mysterious temple of the evil magician Merlock. As she tells the story, she is kidnapped by Merlock. His arch rival Gladstone sets out to find her before Donald, who decides to use Gyro's new invention, the "Tubal Teleport System", to track down Merlock and Daisy. However, a piece of Gyro's device is missing, and to make the machine working again, Donald must go on a journey to recover it. Along the way, he must compete with Gladstone, reverse the spells that Merlock put on Huey, Dewey, and Louie's toys, and defeat several bosses, including the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell. In the end, Donald is able to locate Merlock; he defeats him and rescues Daisy. The temple collapses, but Gyro is able to teleport them back to his lab, where Donald receives a kiss from Daisy for saving her.

Gameplay

Goin' Quackers's gameplay is very similar to that of Crash Bandicoot, and requires the player to move through various settings, such as the forest or the city, while jumping over obstacles. The viewpoint of the levels change from a 2D side-scrolling perspective to a 3D perspective. Re-doing the levels in order to defeat Gladstone's time in same, gives the player advantages in the game.

The game is being re-released for the Nintendo 3DS, and will feature both 2D and 3D levels in full 3D.

Plot

King K. Rool is trying to destroy DK Isles with a large laser called the Blast-O-Matic, but it malfunctions after a crash that puts his floating, mechanical hind face-to-hind with DK Isles. To buy some time, he captures Donkey Kong's friends and locks them up, and then steals Donkey Kong's precious hoard of Golden bananas. As Donkey Kong frees his fellow apes, they set off to recover the bananas and defeat King K. Rool and his army of Kremlings and other evil creatures. But in order to complete the game, there are many collectibles like coins, colored bananas, and pictures of banana fairies you have to get as well.


Gameplay

The game is a 3D adventure with strong platforming links, similar to that of Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. There are a total of five playable Kongs, each with unique (and upgradeable) abilities. The player starts out with access to Donkey Kong only, then goes on to unlock each of the other four Kongs as part of the gameplay (in the order of Diddy, Lanky or Tiny, and then Chunky). Unlocking all 5 Kongs is necessary to defeat character-specific bosses in each level. There are a total of 7 areas (subtracting the DK Isles, the overworld for the game and Hideout Helm): Jungle Japes, Angry Aztec, Frantic Factory, Gloomy Galleon, Fungi Forest, Crystal Caves, and Creepy Castle. Each new Kong that is freed can be accessed as playable through tag barrels that are scattered throughout each world. Additionally, each Kong is represented by a color which works alongside the game's unique collecting system where objects such as bananas and coins can only be collected by the Kong who has that color on the object. The colors are as follows: Yellow for Donkey Kong, Red for Diddy, Purple for Tiny, Blue for Lanky, and Green for Chunky.

Each playable Kong has several different collectables within the game. First and foremost are the Golden Bananas. There are five Golden Bananas per Kong in every level that only that specific character can get. (One Golden Banana per Kong per level can be collected by delivering the color-appropriate blueprint to Snide after getting them from the Kasplats.) The Golden Bananas are used as payment to get past B.Lockers that guard the entrance to every new level.

Each character can also find 100 color-appropriate bananas per level - single bananas, bunches of 5, or balloons to be popped that are worth 10. The regular bananas are necessary to unlock boss fights and acquire Boss Keys. There are eight boss keys in all (though seven of the eight are actually obtained via defeating the area's boss). Boss Keys in turn are used to free K.Lumsy, who in his excitement often unlocks new levels to be completed.


A third important thing to collect is character-specific colored coins. With these coins, each Kong is allowed to buy essential combat items: Cranky Kong's special ability potions, Funky Kong's guns, and Candy Kong's musical instruments (as well as upgrades of the same). All of these skills and supplies are necessary to complete the game, either just by killing enemies or because of specific pads and switches that needed to be activated.

Two single items of grave importance later in the game are the Nintendo and Rare(ware) Coins, that can be obtained in classic games in the game. 15 Banana Medals, which are obtained when a Kong gathers 75 of the 100 regular bananas each can get, will allow the player to play Jetpac to get the Rareware Coin. The Nintendo Coin can only be found in the game's third area, Frantic Factory, with Donkey Kong, by playing the original Donkey Kong Arcade game and winning twice (first for the Golden Banana, and second for the Nintendo Coin).

Other items to be collected are ammunition for guns, orange grenades (usable by all 5 Kongs, and rather self-explanatory) Crystal Coconuts, used to fuel Cranky's special abilities, film for taking banana fairy pictures, and headphones scattered in each level to restore the instruments' powers that Candy gives each Kong.


Multiplayer

Multiplayer can be played by up to four players at one time. It features three arenas, one special arena and six gameplay modes. The five playable characters from the single player adventure are used in the multiplayer mode, along with a secret character, Krusha. If only two players play in the special arena, random baddies will appear to make the game more difficult.

Following the conclusion of the original Doom series, the sole Marine who survived the horrors of hell had returned to Earth, reclaiming it from the invasion that almost eradicated the human race. Demons still lingered within the abandoned halls and complexes of Phobos and Deimos. As a last-ditch effort, the military decided to bombard the moons with extreme radiation in hopes of killing off any remaining demons. Initially it was successful, however something survived the exposure. The extreme radiation blocked the military's sensors and allowed something to slip past them undetected. Now the demons have returned, their corpses revived and strengthened. Hell's forces have been rebuilt and are stronger than ever. A Marine strikeforce was ordered to contain the advancing armies of hell but was mercilessly slaughtered within moments. You, the sole survivor of the last invasion, managed to slip past hell's guards. Once again, it is you versus the legions of hell and this time, it is time to finish it once and for all.

Features

Key differences from the computer games in the series include:

    32 exclusive new levels.
    New, larger sprites for all enemies, items, weapons and projectiles which were texture-filtered when close to the player to prevent pixelation.
    Darker, more foreboding color schemes used to increase a sense of fear in the player.
    No Commandos, Arch-Viles, Spider Masterminds or Revenants (removed due to the expense of low capacity Nintendo 64 cartridges).
    Enemies that appear out of thin air after triggering a tripwire or switch.
    All new textures, scrolling skies, artificial room-over-room architecture, and custom scripting.
    Tripwire booby traps, from darts to homing fireballs.
    The player's viewpoint is from chest level, rather than eye-level, making all objects and characters appear larger in relation to the player.
    Eerie synth ambient music tracks (instead of MIDI rock music)
    More ambivalent usage of Satanic imagery (pentagrams, inverted crosses, depictions of sacrifice) than the computer version of Doom with differing usages of horror schemes.
    More advanced atmospheric colored lighting and effects, such as parallaxing skies, fog, and lightning.
    Re-designed weapons that act more devastating than previous installments of the game series (realistic jostling movements when firing the weapons are also present, including being knocked back a few inches from a fired rocket).


Weapons

All the weapons from the original game are present (Fist, Chainsaw, Pistol, Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Chaingun, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle and BFG 9000), but redrawn with new sprites. The chainsaw was given two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves on instead of brass knuckles, the plasma rifle has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back a bit, the shotgun's reloading cock is at the handle instead of under the barrel and the Super Shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil. A new weapon known as the Laser, or "Unmaker", has been added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma rifle and BFG. It was first mentioned in the Doom Bible and was planned to be featured in the computer Doom games but never appeared. Its appearance in Doom 64 is its only official appearance, and with the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one, the first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once.


Development

Midway's original title of the game was "The Absolution", but the name was changed to "Doom 64" for brand recognition. ("The Absolution" was reused as the name of the last level of the game.) Midway wanted to include every demon from the original games, as well as a few extra levels, into the final product, but deadlines and memory constraints of the small capacity of the N64 cartridges made them scrap the levels and leave a few demons off the game (Former Commando, Revenant, Arch-Vile and Spider Mastermind). The music and sound effects were done by Aubrey Hodges, who also did the original sound and music for the PlayStation port of Doom two years earlier. The original Doom 64 team was working on a potential Doom 64 2 not long after the first game was released, but decided to scrap it due to the "Doom engine looking dated", and players' attention focusing on Quake and other, more modern 3D shooters.

Story

Long ago the Devil (A character designed by Akira Toriyama) was sealed away by the powers of the Three Fairy Spirit Stones. These stones created a barrier which he could not pass, then one day he escapes, and continued his war on the Fairy World people. The Princess of the Sky portion of this world was then asked by her father to go to the Human World and return with Doraemon's three-dimensional pocket. She arrives in the Human World to get Doraemon's pocket, but as she does the Evil King comes, in the form of a bat, and steals it. The princess chases the bat back into her world and disappears. Doraemon Nobita and friends decide to follow her and see if they can get back his pocket. When arriving they find that this human looking princess now has the body of a small fairy complete with wings. She tells them that she was changed into this form by the Devil, and that she managed to get Doraemon's pocket back, but in the struggle all his useful items where lost, among the three areas of Fairy World; Earth, Sea and Sky.

Gameplay

Each of the three main area of the game has four levels, three of them contain pieces of that area's Fairy Spirit Stone, and the fourth a Castle where that area's king is imprisoned. Each king has the power to put their areas stone back together. In order to reach the Devil all three stones must be repaired. The game for most levels is a standard platform game with jumping and shooting. There are four other levels that are played in different ways. (1) Meet and ride in the pouch of a Kangaroo-like Dinosaur. (2) Race a car in an under water course. (3) Ride on the back of a bird-like dragon that can shoot balls of fire, as enemies fall from the top of the screen. (4) Fly using a hat that has a spinning propeller on its top. The main character that is being used to play can be switched by pausing the game and selecting another character, each has their own unique abilities, a sixth character the princess Corona, whose name also means sun's outer layer Corona, can also be unlocked as a playable character once the game has been beaten. Small voice clips from the cartoon actors can be heard when starting any of the levels or when the character is defeated. Many of the boss enemies come from other cultures such as a Minotaur, Harpy, Centaur, and an evil version of Santa Claus. As the demo story plays a Pentagram is seen as the Devil is released form is barrier. The text of the game is entirely in Japanese and appears in a window bar at the bottom of the screen along with an image of the person that it speaking, the image changes when the person is happy sad or another person is talking.


Reception

When the game was released, many Nintendo 64 owners complained that the game was a complete Super Mario 64 rip off. On Gamespot, a reviewer said that "the gameplay was extremely tedious and slow". The reviewer also said that "the game was not original, and was like Super Mario 64 put through a strainer until there's nearly no entertainment value left".

Plot

The flu season has come about, and it's Dr. Mario's duty to use his Megavitamins to heal the people of the land. However, Wario, wanting to have the fame that Dr. Mario has, attempts to steal the Megavitamins, but to no avail. Afterwards, Mad Scienstein and Rudy the Clown (from Wario Land 3) steal the Megavitamins, and both Dr. Mario and Wario give chase. Throughout their adventure, both of them meet up with many creatures from Wario Land 3. Most of the time the fights that emerge are really misunderstandings; for example, the player may accidentally bump into a creature, who gets angry and retaliates. Dr. Mario and Wario follow Mad Scienstein to Rudy's castle, where they fight Rudy to take back the vitamins. If the game is completed on Normal or Hard mode without using a continue, one last battle occurs after defeating Rudy; the opponent is Metal Mario for Wario and Vampire Wario for Dr. Mario.

Gameplay

Dr. Mario 64 plays the same as its predecessors for the most part. Dr. Mario throws Megavitamins into a jar full of Viruses, and after lining up a combination of Viruses and Megavitamins (four at minimum), they disappear. There are three types of Viruses - the Red Virus (Fever), the Blue Virus (Chill) and the Yellow Virus (Weird), with a Megavitamin color designed to kill them. It includes the main songs from the original Dr. Mario, Fever and Chill, but it also includes two new songs called Cube and Que Que.

There are several single-player modes present in the game:

    Classic - This mode features a similar set-up and design to the original Dr. Mario game.
    Story - In this mode the player may take control of either Dr. Mario or Wario to track down the stolen Megavitamins, battling computer players on the way.
    Vs. Computer - In this mode the player may battle against the computer as any character the player has played as or fought against.
    Flash - In this mode the player must eliminate three particular flashing viruses faster than the computer can.
    Marathon - This mode consists of a never-ending rising field of viruses which does not end until the player quits or loses.
    Score Attack - In this mode the player is given three minutes to clear all of the viruses as well as get a high score.

Some modes are available for two players to play simultaneously:

    2-Player Versus - Two players can battle against one another.
    Flash - Two players race to eliminate three particular flashing viruses before the other player can.
    Score Attack - Two players try to get the most points in a three-minute time period.

A "Multiplayer" mode exists as well which allows four people to play at once.


Reception

Dr. Mario 64 in all of its various permutations was voted #76 in the Top 100 Games of All Time poll published by Game Informer Magazine in August 2001.

Story

120 years ago, in preparation for the coming doom, mankind began an exodus to the manmade satellites in outer space. But the "Day of Judgment" arrived even before half the population had escaped to space. The shift in the tectonic plate caused the shape of the Pacific Ocean to change and a new continent was created.

After a 100 years, the only inhabitable area were limited to the area around the new Pacific Ocean and the new continent. New nations were founded on this continent and mankind began rebuilding their lives. In the midst of rebuilding, "Gaiathyst" a mineral which releases an energy similar to gravity was discovered as a new source of endless energy.

The nations began to war with each other for domination, but conventional weapons were found useless due to the influence of the Gaiathyst. To fight under these conditions, the power suits used to mine Gaiathyst were improved for combat. But the "Gaiathyst War" came to an abrupt end by the invading forces of the Zodgierra Empire from outer space.

After conquering the nations, Emperor ZORR creates the "SAP", a super gravity producing device. Orbiting over the new continent, the super gravity of the device, prohibits beings not wearing a power suit to exist under it. Protected by the super gravity, ZORR commands his empire from a tower under the SAP.

A few brave make a stand to defeat ZORR. They are the true Heroes!

Story

Duke is called into action via the Government, aliens have once again landed and are wreaking havoc. Duke pummels the alien menace through the streets of New York with the help of some marines, and eventually gains access to the Statue of Liberty. Here, Duke discovers the aliens true plan, to go back in time, mess with historic events so Earth now wouldn't be what it is and make it so they could easily take over. However, Duke in his fight, is teleported to the future, where the aliens have won and the humans are near extinction. In this time zone, Duke battles through horrors of new alien breeds in the future, and the zombified corpses of those who didn't survive the fallout. Duke eventually meets up with the small band of resistance fighters in the old headquarters of the U.S. army in New York. There, they tell him that the aliens are indeed screwing with history, so much that this future is just one, if Duke wants the old one back he'll have to fight for it. The humans have developed their own time machine in order to send a soldier back to re-write history, and destroy the aliens. Duke is sent back to the Old West, where aliens have taken over parts of the American West in an effort to mine out Earth for its resources.

In the Old West, due to technical difficulties, Duke must make do with period weaponry with the exception of a few of his weapons which his allies can send back. The aliens have begun creating super-soldiers in order to combat Nukem and the humans of the future. After blowing up a ship containing the super-soldiers, Duke makes his way to the town of Roswell. There, he stops the mining project before the aliens can succeed. Duke then is informed, that it's not just America's past that is being altered, the aliens have also been sent to the Victorian Era of London.

In the Victorian Era, Duke is set upon by the biological weaponry the aliens have been manufacturing. Zombies litter the streets, and Brains float in the air. Duke fights toward the castle, which the aliens have taken over (not before blowing up a Zeppelin). In the castle, Duke faces the worst of the horrors the aliens have created, and finally confronts the alien general in charge of it all, a giant brain. After demolishing the castle, and eliminating the alien threat in time, Duke is ready for some R'n'R, unfortunately, the aliens aren't. All of the meddling with time has caused a rift in the space-time continuum, and now more aliens from all of history are pouring into New York in a desperate attempt to destroy humanity.

Once again fighting through the city streets, Duke enters the alien mothership. He fights through wave after wave of aliens in order to confront the monster behind all this madness, Zero. Duke uses the alien technology from the mother ship and battles Zero on the rooftops of the city. After felling the beast, Duke finally sets things right. Duke cleans up Manhattan from the alien menace, and gets ready to relax with his "reward".


Time periods

There are four time periods in Duke Nukem: Zero Hour: Present Day (actually set some time in the near future), Post-Apocalypse, Wild West and Victorian Era (London, 1888). Each time period has its own theme and weaponry. For example, Present Day has modern-day weapons such as automatic handguns, submachine guns and combat shotguns and has Duke fighting the alien invaders. The Wild West has revolvers and lever-action rifles and features cowboy Pig Cops, and the Victorian Era has fictional, science-fiction weaponry such as the Voltaic Projector, and zombies.

Publisher: GT Interactive
Players: Single-player, multiplayer

Duke Nukem 64 is a Nintendo 64 port of the first-person shooter PC (MS-DOS) video game Duke Nukem 3D. There are many changes from the PC version. For instance, some weapons use two different types of ammo and many of the original game's mature themes have been watered down.

Duke Nukem 64 also included multiplayer modes, allowing 4 player deathmatch as well as 2 player co-operative play through split screen.

Duke's pistol can use dum-dum rounds, which are significantly more powerful than the standard ammunition, capable of killing the strongest adversaries in one shot. The shotgun can fire explosive rounds, with devastating results on Duke's enemies; as well as on Duke himself if the player is not careful. Heat-seeking missiles are also available. There are several new weapons as well: a grenade launcher (replacing the RPG), dual SMGs (replacing the chain-gun cannon), the Microwave Expander (from the Atomic Edition), a missile launcher (replacing the Devastator), and the Plasma Cannon (this weapon replaces the Freeze Thrower). The Cannon causes enemies to fade out of existence.

The game levels include real-life locations, such as a bank and a movie lot. There are more fantastic locations, such as a space station overrun by alien biology.

The game is no longer played in episodes, but as one big game, and also includes some levels from the Atomic Edition at various points. All in-game music has been removed, due to the limited storage available on the cartridge; the only music remaining is a remix of the original "Grabbag" theme (on the title screen) and the status screen theme. There are Overlord Clones in tandem with the Battlelord Clones. The new alien boss from the Atomic edition, the Protector Drone renamed as "Alien Beast", has been added to the game; and the Cycloid Emperor (in the final level) is now a fully rendered polygon character.


Censoring

Perhaps the most noticeable change from the original PC version of the game is the removal of almost all sexual content. The "Red Light District" level was renamed "Gun Crazy," and the strip club and adult bookstore replaced with a gun shop and the Duke Burger restaurant from the Plutonium Pak expansion. However the crude humor is more or less intact, the game still features the ability to urinate in the restrooms for extra health. Also, Duke's infamous one-liners have been re-dubbed by the original actor, with potentially offensive language rephrased or removed entirely. Instead of "those alien bastards," Duke says "those alien scum." Phrases such as " eat shit and die" are nowhere to be found. However, the phrase "It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all out of gum" was reused. The Steroids, a vaguely controversial power-up item, were also replaced by the much less questionable "VitaminX."

Other part of the censorship is that the player cannot kill the captive women, but instead has to save them by pressing the action button in front of them in order to teleport them. The total number of "babes" (as it is written in the game) in a level is shown while finishing it, as for enemies killed and secrets found.


Cultural references

There are multiple pop culture references:

    Butt-head, from Beavis and Butt-head, can be heard through the drive-thru speaker of the Duke Burger fast food restaurant, admonishing the player to leave, because the place is 'like, closed'.
    On the level Death Row is the corpse of Snake Plissken, prompting Duke to announce, "I guess he didn't escape from L.A." Later on, the player encounters Hannibal Lecter standing in his prison cell.
    In the level "Hotel Hell" is the corpse of Indiana Jones, found by entering a secret area behind the pool's waterfall. When encountered, Duke says "We meet again, Dr. Jones".
    In the secret level "Area 51" the captured alien fighter from "Independence Day" can be seen in the hangar, and can be entered through a teleporter. Inside is the nuclear missile from the movie.
    In the secret level "Duke Burger" is a reference to Men In Black. In the level, Duke finds a building called the Missing Individuals Bureau, humorously using the film's MIB logo. Inside, posters can be found of humans and aliens wearing black suits and sunglasses. Duke Nukem also has a missing persons poster.
    On one of the Moon levels, the body of Luke Skywalker can be found inside a cave hanging upside down, in reference to the Empire Strikes Back.
    There is also a reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey on level 8 episode 2, where a tall black rectangle; a monolith can be found.
    Duke's one-liners are quotes from various films such as "It's time to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all out of gum", which was said by Roddy Piper's character in the 1988 film They Live, and "Hail to the king" which was spoken by the character Ash Williams in the 1981 film The Evil Dead.
    TV footage parodying the OJ Simpson car chase can still be found in the secret level "Freeway". Similarly, the "Innocent?" billboard in level 1 episode 1, and "Guilty!" billboards in level 5 and level 8 of episode 3 are still present from the PC version.
    One noticeable change from the PC version is the poster of The Blues Brothers, which is still entitled "The Good Old Boys". In the 64 version, Elwood is now bald and Jake had a beard.
    On the Level 'L.A. Rumble' the corpse of the Doomguy can be found instead of on the level; Death Row, as it was in Duke Nukem 3D.

Earthworm Jim 3D

Developer: VIS Entertainment
Publisher: Rockstar Games
Players: Single-player

Plot

Earthworm Jim is hit by a flying cow that sends him into a coma. Jim awakens within his own mind and discovers he has gone insane. His past villains have entered his mind and if something doesn't happen soon, Jim will be in the coma forever. His super ego has been unleashed within his mind to stop the madness. To restore his sanity he must find the Golden Udders of lucidity. When Jim enters his mind, he finds out that his four mind chambers have been taken over by his worst fears. He must collect Golden Udders to unlock the other three chambers and Green Marbles to unlock the levels within the chamber. Jim defeats four villains who took over his mind chambers, and finally faces the personification of his trauma: Earthworm Kim.

Gameplay

Earthworm Jim 3D borrows much of its gameplay from other platformers of the era, notably competing with Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario 64. New locations in Jim's brain are opened up by collecting Golden Udders, and new levels in each location are opened by collecting Jim's marbles. Like previous Earthworm Jim games, despite many platforming elements, Jim's primary method of combat comes from shooting his blaster.


Main characters

    Earthworm Jim - The hero of the game. After getting hit by a falling cow, Jim's worst fears and anxieties were unleashed and are destroying his psyche. As a last line of defense, Jim's four worm brains embody Jim as his own superego, and send him out to collect his marbles to repair his damaged IQ. When he starts off the game, he's as smart as pond scum. More levels within Jim's brains open as Jim gets smarter.
    Peter Puppy - Earthworm Jim's friend. He basically tells Jim inside of his mind what happened after the cow fell on him and what to do about the resulting turmoil his mind is in.
    Snott - A booger who is also Jim's friend. He appears from time to time, giving Jim hints and telling him how to perform moves.
    The Sacred Cow of Contemplation - A cow that controls the portals to Jim's brains. His powers can only be recharged when Jim finds Golden Udders. He is a master of disguise (i.e., he wears an afro in Fear, a chef hat in Happiness, a cowboy hat in Fantasy and an army hat in Memory).
    Psy-Crow - the evil space crow who took over the "Memory" portion of Jim's mind.
    Fatty Roswell - alien chef who entered Jim's "Happiness" mind chamber to find the recipe of the Ultimate Burger.
    Professor Monkey-For-A-Head - the mad professor has taken over "Fear" section of Jim's mind.
    Bob the Killer Goldfish - Jim's old nemesis who, along with his henchman Number 4, has taken over "Fantasy" mind chamber.
    Earthworm Kim - Jim's suppressed femenistic persona, she is the personification of Jim's trauma and the final opponent of the game. If all green marbles are collected, she could be selected as playable character for a replay of the game (this makes game harder and also places Earthworm Jim as the final boss).



Development

During its drawn-out three year development cycle, Earthworm Jim 3D changed publishers several times. This caused some problems as the game was based on the Earthworm Jim TV series which by the time of release, had been off the air for over 3 years. Also many locations displayed in early versions of the game are nowhere to be found in the released copy (such as a level set in a house, where Jim is ant-sized), and locations that were kept from early screenshots changed drastically before release. In some cases, entire characters were changed - originally, Evil the Cat was to be the boss of Fear, but was changed to Professor Monkey-For-A-Head at the last moment, although his face can be seen on the records and record needles in the level "Boogie Nights of the Living Dead". Additionally, Evil Jim, Earthworm Jim's evil twin from the cartoon series, was reportedly a part of the game. Early screenshots and footage also display Jim riding his Pocket Rocket, with a fuel meter, in races and other missions, as well as snowboarding.

At the time, original series designer David Perry had sold the rights to the franchise. The characters had to be redesigned for the shift from side-scrolling 2D to free-roaming 3D.[2] Perry and original series creator Doug TenNapel were at first involved in the game as minor consultants, but their advice was dismissed for unexplained reasons, and they eventually left. TenNapel has since showed extreme hatred towards the game whenever talking about it, and Perry has expressed regrets over selling the franchise. Problems were still arising in the game as development started to near completion.


Reception

Reviews towards Earthworm Jim 3D were mixed. Earthworm Jim 3D was thought to be a solid platforming game with a good selection of levels and weapons, but with a terrible camera system and a lack of any big innovations. Gamespot gave it a 6.3, praising the controls while also criticizing the camera, stating that it was on a "kamikaze mission" to destroy the game. The PC version scored lower, with a rare 3.2; the review stated, "Earthworm Jim 3D has something to discourage all types of people from playing it". IGN was slightly more forgiving for the N64 version, giving it a 7.3, praising sound, graphics, and presentation, but criticizing the camera and lasting appeal. They also stated that is was good for rent at best. The PC version also scored lower, with a 6.0(passable). Heavy criticism targeted the lasting appeal, presentation, and sound, but they deemed it playable despite the camera problems. It was compared to Super Mario 64 and Rayman 2: The Great Escape, stating that they couldn't make it after these games.

ECW Hardcore Revolution is a professional wrestling video game released by Acclaim Entertainment, based on the professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). The game was released for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Dreamcast and Game Boy Color. It was the first wrestling game to be based on ECW, as well as the first professional wrestling game to receive a Mature rating from the ESRB but rated Everyone on the Game Boy Color. The game was criticized for being a near copy of its predecessor, WWF Attitude and not reflecting ECW's unique style, just covering over everything with ECW wrestlers and themes.[3] Acclaim followed this title with the release of a sequel, ECW Anarchy Rulz, six months after this game was released.

It has a rating of 47% at Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised Joey Styles's commentary, and the use of weapons during the game. However, most reviews were negative. Metacritic gave Hardcore Revolution 45 out of 100 reviews positive. IGN gave the game a mere 3/10. Gamespot was the worst reviewer, and gave the game a 2/10, making this one of its worst-rated games.

Gameplay

You can choose from one of six riders, each with his own pre-set handling attributes. To control the bike, use the analog or D-pad moving the bike A to accelerate, B to brake, R for slide, and Z for a turbo boost. Just as in the original, holding down gives you more air on jumps, while holding up aims your front wheel forward to enable landing on slopes. The game isn't meant to be an accurate motorbiking simulation. It chooses to follow the original in giving "extreme" jumps and physics, creating a far more "exciting" atmosphere.

Features

The main game features a 20-track season mode. Completing races unlocks more tracks and features. Also included is a tutorial that will teach you how to play through 17 different tracks. Also included are a variety of exhibitions and time trial modes that let you do more activities other than the main game. A major feature is the track editor, where you can create your own fully-functional track and save it into the game. The announcer, Limua, shouts out the tricks and crashes throughout the race. Also featured is the original Exitebike, the first in the series.

Plot

Extreme-G is set in the distant future where Earth is a mere wasteland. From their new found planet the human colonists watch with joy as their remote controlled power-bikes wreak havoc through their ancient cities. There is only one winner, the first to cross the line… or the last to survive.

Overview

As with all Extreme-G games, futuristic racing pilots race plasma-powered bikes in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that are over 750 km/h making it the third fastest racing game on the Nintendo 64, only beaten by F-Zero X and Star Wars: Episode I Racer. The emphasis is on speed and creative racetrack design, with tracks looping through like roller coasters.

At the beginning of each round, the player is given three "nitro" powerups which provide a temporary speed boost (these powerups cannot be replenished). Also, falling off cliffs or, in some cases, the track itself results in simply losing time rather than losing 'lives'; bikes are teleported back to the track and must rebuild their speed and lost time from a dead standstill. Some parts of many tracks are shown to be hundreds of feet in the air.

This is the only game in the series where a vehicle is unable to reach Mach Speed but nothing is impossible.

Gameplay

The gameplay of Extreme-G consists mainly of fast-paced racing through an array of futuristic environments. An impressive array of defensive and offensive weapons is available on-track. These include multi-homing/reverse missiles, magnetic/laser mines, and shield-boosting power-ups. Special weapons can also be found such as invisibility, phosphorus flash and the mighty Wally-Warp which if not avoided, can instantly transport a bike right to the back of the pack.


Vehicles

Each of the machines has their own strengths and weaknesses. These are decided by the following 5 characteristics:

    Accel (acceleration)
    Speed (maximum velocity)
    Turns (handling)
    Shield (electronic armor battery life)
    Weap (primary weapons battery life)

Another variable between the bikes is the type of primary weapon the bike has installed. There are three types Pulse, Laser and Excel; again each having its own strengths and weaknesses. With the characteristics varying considerably between vehicles, some will be better than others at reaching specific goals.

Gameplay

This iteration, as with all Extreme-G games, is about futuristic racing: pilots race plasma-powered Tron-like bikes in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that are over 999 mph. It is possible to break the sound barrier in this game, creating a sonic boom. While travelling at supersonic speeds, all game sounds are muted except the sound of the vehicle travelling. If the bike slows down to below supersonic speeds, another sonic boom can be heard and all game sounds will resume. The emphasis is on speed and creative racetrack design, with tracks looping through all three dimensions like roller coasters.

The game's controls are fairly sensitive, so players may have to practice with a given machine before diving right into the Grand Prix. Visuals as well as the level layouts contribute to the immense speed of the game.

Each of the machines have their own handling characteristics, with varying top speeds, armor values and traction values. All of the machines in the game have an energy meter – with two separate energy stores for protective shields and a basic primary weapon. If a machine loses all of its shield energy, it will explode on contact, causing the player to lose a life or the match. It is also possible for players to fall off the tracks when driving through jumps or similar obstacles. In this case, the player is simply teleported back to the track. Players are given three "Nitro" boosts per race.

Extreme-G has a championship mode ranging from novice to expert, shoot-em-up mode (named "Arcade Mode" in XG2), multiplayer racing, and deathmatch. In shoot-em-up/arcade mode, computer drones follow a lunar path while the player attempts to destroy them with Extreme-G's arsenal of weapons. The idea came from Tron and Atari's Tempest 2000.

Gameplay

The game featured all the tracks from that Formula One season, at a time when the racing began in Australia, and ended in Japan. Teams would be set up with relevant drivers, however there was a roster-feature included, which allowed the player to swap drivers from one team to another, and even removing a real driver and replacing him with unknown drivers named Driver 1-6.

Grand Prix Mode allowed players to progress through the racing calendar, you could also choose single races or a time trial on various tracks. Battle mode allowed you to pick who you wanted to race against over a however many laps you chose. This added challenges to see if you could go from the back of the grid to 1st over one lap of Interlagos, Brazil. The game lacked destructible vehicles, and allowed players to only drive a maximum of 10 laps on every track, rendering the game quite unrealistic compared to other F1 games on the N64 such as F-1 World Grand Prix, released in 1998, and F-1 World Grand Prix II, released in 2000. The game also featured primitive graphics, almost reminiscent of the 16-bit Super Nintendo. For some reason, Rubens Barrichello's helmet is the only one rendered correctly out of all the drivers.

Gameplay

The game consists of five gameplay modes: Grand Prix, a course-by-course simulation of the 1997 season; Exhibition, a single race; Time Trial, a race against the clock and Challenge, which comprised real scenarios from the 1997 season-examples include trying to win the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix as Damon Hill or beating Jean Alesi as David Coulthard in the 1997 Italian Grand Prix. The final mode allowed 2 players to compete in a single, split-screen race.

F-1 World Grand Prix offered a fairly realistic experience for its time. Prior to races, allowed for the fine-tuning of the player's car; including tyre tread, amount of fuel and wing angle. The cars themselves followed realistic simulated physics and were at risk of damage and wear like their real-life counterparts. Weather (and its effects) was also simulated. Visually, the game offered the same trademark appearance of live F1 coverage, and aimed to have a photo-realistic appeal.

F-1 World Grand Prix was highly acclaimed by most critics, more so than its sequel F-1 World Grand Prix II, which many felt lacked a sufficient number of improvements over the original.

Due to copyright issues, WilliamsF1 driver Jacques Villeneuve is not featured in the game and in his place is a silhouette of his body and his name is simply Driver Williams. This character's name could be customized by the player, either to personalise their driver or to unlock certain extras, such as the Silver and Gold racers.

Gameplay

F-Zero X is a futuristic racing video game where thirty pilots race on circuits inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that can reach 1500 km/h.Taking place after the original tournament was discontinued for several years due to the extreme danger of the sport, F-Zero X begins after the Grand Prix is brought back with the rules and regulations revised under the same name as the video game. The tracks in the game include hills, loops, tunnels, corkscrews, and pipes. Some courses have innate obstacles like dirt patches, tricky jumps, and tubes to navigate. The game introduces 26 new vehicles, and brings back the four from the original F-Zero game. Each has its own characteristics and performance abilities and before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. The game can be used with a Rumble Pak, which allows for force feedback.

A normal race in F-Zero X consists of three laps around the track. Each machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. It is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. If the player has a "spare machine"—the equivalent of an extra life—then falls off a track or runs out of energy, the race will be restarted. The game introduces the ability to attack the other racers by either utilizing a side or spin attack. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips, called "Pit Zones", located at various points around the track. There are also dash plates around the track that give a speed boost without using up any energy

F1 Racing Championship was a game developed by Ubisoft in 2000. It featured all the 22 drivers and 11 teams from the 1999 Formula One World Championship, as well as the 16 tracks (including the brand new Sepang Circuit. The game featured great graphics and realistic handling. At the time, it was facing steep competition by the ever popular Grand Prix 3 and the rising F1-series by ISI. The sales were behind expectations. Reasons were a poor Artificial Intelligence and damage model and the bug-prone initial release. A patch to fix the reported issues was announced, but never released.

The soundtrack was recorded by British band Garbage, the main audio sounds in the menu were replicated in Racing Simulation 3, brought out a couple of years later, which again didn't sell well due to licensing issues.

Game features

The game included an official soundtrack and had a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadiums, improved artificial intelligence and the popular "Road to World Cup" mode, with all 173 FIFA-registered national teams. It even featured many accurate team rosters, including national reserves for national call-up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. In addition, eleven leagues were featured, containing 189 clubs. It was also the first FIFA game to contain an in-game player/team editor.

For the first time in a FIFA game, the offside rule was properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit version of the game corrected this so only if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was, the game would award a free kick for offside. The game also featured a five-a-side indoor mode.

With the new graphical improvements, players were able to have individual faces. However, they looked more like expressions, as the starting elevens of Bulgaria and Ukraine could consist of "sad"-looking players, while the starting eleven of Macedonia could have "tough"-looking players.

No subsequent edition of the FIFA series has attempted to replicated FIFA 98's inclusion of every FIFA national team.

While the indoor mode was no longer featured, the gameplay's fluidity and responsiveness was increased. The increasing number of websites dedicated to the game and a larger number of leagues (the Malaysian league was removed, and on its stead came two new leagues: the Belgian First Division and the Portuguese Liga; this came to be a problem when the owners of the rights to the Primeira Liga tried to pull the game from the shelves locally) ensured good sales. Graphically, it is a major improvement over FIFA '98, with the inclusion of basic facial animations and different players' heights as well as certain other cosmetic features such as improved kits and emblems, although they are unlicensed. Gamers may also create their own custom cups and leagues and select the teams they wish to participate.

FIFA 99 also features an elite league called the "European Dream League" in which 20 top teams from across Europe battle it out in a league format. It was also the first game to feature a block containing teams which did not pertain to any of the main leagues (back then, it was known as "Rest of Europe" since all teams were European, the vast majority of them featured either in the 1998-99 season of the UEFA Cup or Champions League).

Gameplay

In Fighters Destiny, the player controls a polygon-based character in a three dimensional battle arena. The game features typical hand to hand combat fighting: using a variety of punches, kicks, locks, and throws, players attempt to pummel their opponents into submission. Each character also has a large list of special commands (called "moves") that can be accessed during battle. These different moves range from simply pressing the "B" button to inputting highly complicated button combinations.

In most versus fighting games, the objective is to deplete the opponent's health gauge. Fighters Destiny follows the same concept but also relies on a customizable point scoring system to determine the winner. These points, which are displayed as yellow stars under the character's health gauge, can be earned in a variety of ways. By default, knocking the character off the fighting platform (a "Ring Out") is worth one point, taking down an opponent with a throw nets the player two points, while a typical K.O. is worth three points, as well as taking the opponent down with a counterattack, and executing a "special" is worth four points. Finally, if the adjustable time counter runs out, then the winner is awarded one point by virtue of judge's decision. By default setting, the first fighter to score seven points wins the match.

K.O.'s can be achieved with instant-K.O. hits (referred to as "1-shot") or counterattack moves, or can be executed with a finishing blow when the player's opponent is in "Piyori condition," a brief spell of dizziness in which opponent's life bar has been drained completely and the fighter is allowed only limited control. "Specials" can only be executed when the opponent is in Piyori condition. If players are able to survive until Piyori condition passes, their health gauge refills completely. The health bar also refills continuously (albeit slowly) throughout the fight.

Fighters Destiny offers five different gameplay modes. By playing the traditional versus computer mode, players can earn a new character (Boro) and learn new skills for their character. They can also select to fight against a second player, challenge their skills and gain new characters in "Record Attack," play through the "Master Challenge" to expand their character's command list, and train against a robot character. When players learn new skills playing the computer or the Master Challenge, they can save their character's expanded command list to the Controller Pak; afterwards, the new command list can be accessed in any mode to aid the player.

Overview

Fighting Force is part of the 'beat 'em up' genre. Players control one of four characters. They move through urban and science fiction environments, battling waves of oncoming enemies with weapons ranging from fists and bottles to knives, chairs and guns. The player can make some choices as to which territory to travel through.

The four characters have various reasons for taking on Dr. Zeng, a criminal mastermind with an army at his command. The action starts with a police cordon around Zeng's office skyscraper, moving to such locales as a shopping mall, subway and Coast Guard base before finally ending at the top of Zeng's island headquarters.

Characters
A screenshot of Ben "Smasher" Jackson punching a generic enemy

The player or players can choose from a selection of four characters. The playable characters are Hawk Manson (age 26), Mace Daniels (age 21), Ben "Smasher" Jackson (age 29), and Alana McKendricks (age 17). Hawk Manson and Mace Daniels are two all-around characters. Hawk is somewhat stronger than Mace who is in turn faster than Hawk. Ben "Smasher" Jackson is a large and slow bruiser capable of lifting and throwing the engines of cars at enemies. Alana McKendricks is a fast but soft-hitting teenager with an effective jump-kick.

All four characters have a special move that can be performed with the loss of a portion of health.

Flying Dragon, known in Japan as Hiryu no Ken Twin (??????? Hiryu no Ken Tsuin?, "Twin Fists of the Flying Dragon"), is a fighting game with RPG elements. Released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, it was developed and published in Japan by Culture Brain, while it was published in North America and Europe by Natsume. The game received relatively low scores on specialized reviews at the time of its release. It had a sequel a year later titled as S.D. Hiryu no Ken Densetsu.

Its most notable feature was the game's SD mode that featured a character progression system, in which characters advance in levels as they become more experienced, and in which it is possible to collect credits and treasure items to equip characters with.

Flying Dragon was also an NES game released by Culture Brain in 1989[1], where the player controlled a martial artist trying to recover magical scrolls stolen by the evil Tusk Soldiers. It was afforded a nominal sequel with Flying Warriors.


Characters

The game consists of two different fighting modes, though the two share many common characters.

SD Version

    Ryuhi - This hot blooded fighter is the leader of the "Dragon Warriors" and an expert with Kung Fu. His home country is China and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Ryuhi is considered to being the main character of the Hiryu No Ken series, due to the fact that he appears in neary every game of the series and that the storyline of Hiryu No Ken is often focused around him.

    Hayato - This calm, gifted fighter, is familiar with all types of fighting styles. His Home country is Japan and his fighting style is Kobujutsu. Hayato is known best for being Ryuhi's friendly rival and a member of the "Dragon Warriors".

    Suzaku - This mysterious evil man, set on revenge, plans on conquering the world. His home Country is the Underworld and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Suzaku is known for being the right-hand man of Ryumaou, the series' dark antagonist.

    Yuka - A master of "Aiki-Jyujyutsu" she can throw any opponent. Her home country is Japan and her fighting style is Jyujyutsu. Yuka's pre-battle quotes to Ryuhi implies that she may in fact have a crush on him.

    Robo no Hana - The Yokozuna of Robot Sumo, who dreams of becoming the best hero in the universe. He has no home country and his fighting style is Robot Sumo. It is to be noted that Robot Sumo is held on the distant planet of Dousokui, which probably means that Robo no Hana is an alien visiting Earth. It is also to be noted that Robo no Hana had originated from the Super Chinese series, in which he appears in Super Chinese Fighter for the Super Famicom.

    Wiler - This Warrior is strong and reliable. He uses Martial Arts learned in the US Army. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mix of Martial Arts and amateur wrestling. Wiler is also known for being a member of the "Dragon Warriors"

    Powers - The top wrestler of the NCW, he plans on being the strongest in the world. His home county is the United States and his fighting style is Pro Wrestling. His physical appearance makes him resemble the former professional wrestler The Ultimate Warrior.

    Shouryu - This young ghost hunter uses ESP and he is currently training in Mexico. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mixture of martial arts and Lucha Libre wrestling. Shouryu is known for being a member of the "Dragon Warriors". It is hinted by their pre-battle quotes that Shouryu and Suzaku know each other from the past.

    Bokuchin (unlockable character) - Possibly the most mysterious character of the bunch. His physical appearance makes him look like a doll brought to life. He has no known fighting style, home country, or even his own stage. He also has the most limited moveset of all the characters. Like Robo no Hana, Bokuchin had originated from the Super Chinese series, first appearing in Super Chinese 3 for the Famicom.

    Ryumaou (unlockable character) - He is usually the main boss of both the SD and the Virtual modes. He rules the Underworld as the Devil King and is one of the fiercest and dangerous characters in the game. It is to be noted that the playable Ryumaou is a clone created by Shin Ryumaou, who is the boss for the clone.

Version 1.5 (set a few years after the SD version; only four characters return)

    Adult Ryuhi
    Adult Hayato
    Red Falcon - A mysterious man who has a wicked attitude in battle.
    Min Min - A young Hong Kong Chinese girl who practices the Kochouken style of Kung Fu. Min Min is also a member of the "Dragon Warriors".
    Kate - A Swedish police officer who uses lightning-fast kicks.
    Raima - A Japanese ninja robot who is given the mission of protecting the world's peace.
    Gengai - Ryuhi's sensei who is the grandmaster of Shorinji.
    Adult Shouryu
    Adult Ryumaou (unlockable character)
    Adult Shin Ryumaou (boss)

Sequel

An updated version of the game entitled SD Hiryu no Ken Densetsu (SD?????? "SD Legend of the Fist of the Flying Dragon"?) was released in Japan only, and added more characters (such as Jack, Ryu, and Gofire from the Super Chinese series), items and a new gameplay mode. It also removed the more realistic "Virtual mode", favoring the super deformed "Quest mode".

Plot

In the distant future, the advancement of science has exceeded humanity's ability to control it. During a subatomic experiment, an accident causes an uncontrollable fusion reaction, utterly destroying the surface of the planet Earth.

One year later, Earth has been classified as "condemned" by the ruling imperial theocracy, meaning that it is now legal for anyone to salvage anything left on the planet. Mercenaries from all over come to raid the dead planet, forced to battle not only each other, but the robot sentinels that the government has left behind.

Gameplay

Forsaken is primarily a multiplayer first-person shooter. The game may be played in singleplayer or multiplayer modes. The game is based on a 3D-engine that allows unlimited 360-degree movements. This concept is similar to the Descent series. According to a GameSpot review, "Forsaken is, at its core, a Descent clone. But stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and above-average level design make the whole thing seem fresh.

Storyline

In ages past, a corrupt mage named Garm used a set of Runestones to summon a demon named Skorne (It is not stated what Garm intended to use Skorne for; however, as Gauntlet Legends introduces Garm as a "greedy young mage", it can be assumed he wanted Skorne for his own personal gain.) However, Skorne crushed Garm and imprisoned his soul in the Underworld. Skorne, fearing the power of the Runestones, scattered them throughout the four realms, so that they could never be used against him. The player(s) must defeat the end bosses of each of the four realms to obtain the four golden keys which allow access to Skorne's temple. While traveling through each realm, he/she/they must also collect the Thirteen Runestones from where they have been scattered. The complete set of Runestones allows him/her/them to pursue Skorne to the Underworld in order to finally destroy him. The players must find 3 rune stones on each kingdom in order to defeat Skorne in the Underworld, and of course 1 from the battle grounds.

Characters

A new aspect of the Gauntlet series is established in Legends: the ability to level up the player's character(s) as the game is played, increasing their abilities through experience earned by slaying enemies and acquiring treasure, similar to the character progression methods in many role-playing video games. The four primary attributes are:

    Strength - Determines damage dealt by physical attacks.
    Speed - Determines character movement and attack rates.
    Armor - Determines amount of damage character takes from enemy attacks.
    Magic - Determines the range and effectiveness of magic potion attacks (see Items below).

Attributes increase with each level attained; increases can also be purchased from the Items menu with gold acquired in gameplay.

The stock fantasy characters from the original Gauntlet return for Legends; as before, each has greater starting ability in a single attribute than their fellows.

    Warrior/Minotaur - Strength
    Wizard/Jackal/Sumner - Magic
    Archer/Tigress - Speed
    Valkyrie/Falconess - Armor

Character progression is saved through a password system; a player can progress all four characters to a maximum level of 99, and each of their attributes to a maximum of 999.


Items

There are many categories of items in Gauntlet Legends, as well as some unique ones. Most are contained in treasure chests and barrels scattered throughout the game, but some can be found lying in the open; most can also be purchased from the Items menu between levels. You can also disable the items and save them for later use. Gold is distributed through the game in a similar manner.

    Amulets: Amulets add power to each standard attack, but can only last up to 90 seconds. Various types are fire, acid, electric, and light, and there is no apparent difference in attack power. The only catch is that the character cannot equip multiple amulets simultaneously.
    Breaths: Breaths allow the character to damage all enemies within a small semicircle in front of him/her, and come in increments of five, but cannot exceed 15. Like amulets, they come in fire, electric and acid breaths, however there is no light breath.
    Shields: Shields form an indestructible wall in front of the character. In addition to preserving the character's health, it also damages any enemies that come in contact to it. They come in two varieties, fire and electric.
    Shot Multipliers: There are only two types (3 way and 5 way) and they allow the character to shoot 3 or 5 shots at once, as opposed to the standard 1 shot.
    Potions: Potions exist for one main reason, but can serve several others. The primary function of potions when one's character is at an early level is to kill Death, a character who is hidden in various chests and barrels and drains 100 health from any character he comes in contact with. They can also be used to attack several enemies at once within a certain radius, increasing in range and potency as the player character's skill with magic increases. Potions can be used three different ways: thrown, dropped at one's feet, or used as a momentary shield (similar to the Shield items, but only a few seconds in duration).
    Keys: They open chests and certain doors, and appear in chests, barrels, and on the ground.



Critical response

Gauntlet Legends has received mixed reviews on all ports and releases. According to GameRankings.com, Gauntlet Legends received a 73.8 out of 100 for the Dreamcast, a 71.1 for the N64, and a 60.4 for the PlayStation version.

Gex - Enter The Gecko
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1998
Developer: Realtime Associates
Publisher: Midway
Players: Single-player
_________________________
*
Plot

Since his retirement from the public eye in 1996, Gex has resided himself to a life of solitude. For two years Gex started his day watching Kung-Fu Theater (Supermarket Sweep in the European release), eventually life started to feel like a telethon (he states that days, then weeks blurred into one long, sorry afternoon chat show).

One day, Gex was watching his TV when it suddenly went blank. The screen then began to flash a familiar face, over and over again, the face was that of Rez. The next thing Gex knows, two government agents show up at his side, requesting Gex's help. Gex denies, saying he's already saved the universe once. One of the agents then beats Gex over the head with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious.

When Gex wakes up, he realizes he is in an interrogation room. The two agents ask him what he knows about Rez, Gex tells them everything. Once again they ask for his help, one of the agents reaches under the table, pulls out a briefcase and slides it over to Gex. Gex opens it and sees that it is full of cash, and immediately starts counting it. Just when Gex thinks it couldn't get any better, the other agent tosses him a secret agent suit. Gex agrees to help them. The two agents give him a map, and say they want Rez to "disappear", instructing him to hide the body between Jimmy Hoffa's and Spuds MacKenzie's.

As Gex leaves the building, a beautiful female agent walks up to him, and introduces herself as "Agent Xtra", she wishes him good luck and leaves. Gex then leaves to the Media Dimension.

Once Gex is in the Media Dimension, he navigates through several channels. Cartoon (Toon TV); horror (Scream TV); sci-fi (The Rocket Channel); futuristic (Circuit Central); Kung-Fu (Kung-Fu Theater); Pre-history (The Pre-History Channel); Rezopolis; and Channel Z. Once Gex navigates through Rezopolis and Channel Z, he fights the overlord again. By dropping a large TV on top of him, Gex defeats Rez. Rez once again transforms into a ball of energy, and is then trapped in the same TV Gex dropped on him.

Rez tells Gex that he is his father, Gex asks how that could be possible. Rez says that he didn't always look like he does now, and that he fell into a scrap heap while trying to get free cable. Regardless, Gex picks up the remote, and is about to turn off the TV, when Rez begs him not to, saying he will do anything. Gex then shuts off the TV and makes a snide remark. To this day it still not known whether Rez truly is Gex's father, possibly meaning a retcon, or whether this was merely a reference to Star Wars.

Gex is last seen in a hotel room with (in a cameo appearance) Nikki, from the Pandemonium video games (particularly her Pandemonium 2 look).


Gameplay

Enter the Gecko is Gex's first foray into 3D world. His main moveset involves a tail whip attack, bouncing on his tail, using his tongue to eat flies, and performing a karate kick. He can also climb up on certain surfaces, and swim underwater.

The game takes place in a large hub filled with several TV screens based on various genres, parodying various genres from Looney Tunes to Star Wars. Each level has about three remotes to collect, as well as an additional one for collecting 120 collectibles within the level. Collecting enough remotes unlock new areas, bonus levels and boss levels.


Gex 64

Gex 64 was the Nintendo 64 port of Gex: Enter the Gecko.

This version featured a new level, which replaced the secret levels. "Gecques Cousteau", which is centered on the RMS Titanic, is played almost entirely underwater. The only land parts of the level are at the entrance to the Titanic, which is sunk by the iceberg.

Other changes include fewer bonus levels and fewer quotes, due to the Nintendo 64 cartridges storing significantly less data for games than CDs. Some of the sound effects were altered slightly. The only normal level that was removed was Scream TV's "Poltergex".

Plot

When Gex is watching TV one day, he discovers that Rez has kidnapped Agent Xtra (the agent from Gex: Enter the Gecko's backstory), head of the TV Terrorist Defense Unit, to get to him. He teleports to the batcave-like lair he has in the Media Dimension, and begins another adventure. Each level parodies a certain aspect of television culture. Gex enters each level through a television set. He must collect remote controls to advance to the next level in order to complete his mission and rescue Xtra.

Gameplay

Gameplay remains similar to the previous game, Gex: Enter the Gecko, with the addition of certain vehicles, such as a tank, a camel and a snowboard, as well as a gliding ability available with certain costumes. Levels are accessed via a more expansive hub, with more areas unlocked as the player collects remotes from each of the levels. Players can unlock and control three alternate characters, Rex, Cuz and Alfred, during bonus stages, though they play the same.

 Characters

Four new characters appear in this sequel. Agent Xtra, a live action female government Spy and whom Gex must help rescue from the clutches of Rez. Gex is also joined by his faithful butler, Alfred the tortoise who is a slight character reference to Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth. Alfred basically helps around and maintains Gex's secret lair which is known as "Mission Control". Alfred can be found in parts of most levels and tailwhipping him gives useful advice. The two last are Rex, a red Dinosaur who Gex unfroze from a block of ice and Cuz Gex's cousin, who prove important for later use in the game.

Media: Cartridge
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1998
Developer: Interactive Studios
Publisher: Hasbro Interactive
Players: Single-player
_________________________

Plot

In a peaceful, idyllic kingdom, a kindly wizard rules over various lands from his large castle. The beauty and harmony of the kingdom are protected by seven magical crystals, which sit on the spires of the castle. The wizard is aided in his magic by a pair of magic gloves, which are sentient. One day, though, the wizard accidentally mixes together a bad batch of potions, which create a massive explosion. The mishap turns the wizard into a statue, and sends his magic gloves in two directions—one flies out the window, while the other lands in a cauldron. The explosion also shakes the crystals from the spires, and they hurtle to the ground. The glove that landed outside—Glover—quickly casts a spell to transform the crystals into rubber balls to prevent them from shattering to the ground. They bounce away, entering the magical realms around the kingdom. Without the crystals, though, the world transforms into a foggy, desolate wasteland. To make matters worse, the other glove is corrupted by the potion in the cauldron and becomes the villain, Cross-Stitch.

Glover realizes that he must find the seven crystals and restore them to the fountain underneath the castle. He traverses from realm to realm, and must protect the rubber balls at all costs. As he does, Cross-Stitch attempts to thwart him by setting traps and creating monsters, but Glover's magical skill defeats the beasts. As the crystals are returned, the world is gradually restored to its former state. In the end, Glover fights Cross-Stitch in an outer space-themed realm, and recovers the last crystal. The wizard is brought back to life, and uses his magic to purify Cross-Stitch. All ends happily, and the world is once again at peace.


Gameplay


Crystals are rescued by guiding Glover and his ball around six worlds, each containing three levels, a boss and bonus stage. The ball can also be transformed into one of four (five with the Power Ball cheat) forms. These are the rubber ball, a metallic marble, bowling ball, the ball's original crystal form and the Power Ball. The crystal form is very fragile, but gives Glover double points for Garibs. This causes Glover to place great value on this form of the crystal. His apocalyptic wail is accompanied by dramatic zoom effect whenever the crystal is shattered by a thoughtless or malicious adversary. There are also plenty of magic potions to help Glover with his quest by giving him power-ups.

Glover's ball can be rolled, bounced, thrown, slapped, or walked on top of. While walking on the ball, the controls are reversed (except on easy difficulty). Walking on the ball is automatic while moving the ball across water. Glover can also collect cards (known as "Garibs") which allow him to access the bonus stages if he collects all of the Garibs in a given world.


Worlds

Glover travels through each of the seven worlds below. Each has a crystal.

    Crystal Kingdom: This is the large area outside of the castle, where all the magical realms are linked. When the game begins, it is a barren desert, populated by bats and creeping things. After completing each realm, Glover returns here to bring that area's crystal to the castle fountain, where the stone wizard rests. There is also a "practice" well for first-time players. As Glover restores the crystals from each realm, the world slowly transforms into a lush landscape, until peace and beauty are restored in the end.

    Atlantis: This is the first realm of the game. Its portal is in a temple-like building. It has ancient flair, with columns and reflecting pools. The enemies are largely aquatic, including a shark-based mechanism and spiked fish. The boss of the area is a triple threat: a mammoth whale, a snapping crab, and a bubble-blasting flying fish.

    Carnival: This is the second realm of the game. Its doorway is in a circus tent. This land is bright, cheery, and colorful. There are amusement park rides, games of chance, and nasty enemies. The boss is a villainous clown that Cross-Stitch zaps to gigantic proportions.

    Pirates: This is the third realm of the game. Its gateway is in a treasure chest. Sandy shores, pirate ships, and meddlesome monkeys make Glover's trip here far from a day at the beach. The realm's guardian is an orangutan that swings from the trees to attack the hero.

    Prehistoric: This is the fourth realm of the game. Glover accesses it through a volcano. The hero moves from a land where dinosaurs roam to a frigid ice age with the crystal. Cross-Stitch reanimates a fire-breathing beast to fight Glover at the world's end.

    Fortress Of Fear: This is the fifth realm of the game. Its passage is housed in a tower-like structure. Glover must face his fears as he moves through this realm of monsters, evil spells, and electric traps. In the boss level, he fights a reanimated Frankenstien-esque creature.

    Out of this World: This is the last realm of the game. It is reached by moving through a meteor. Here, gravity no longer applies as Glover explores an alien planet and flies in a spaceship. He also faces his final battle with Cross-Stitch, and both pilot giant robots in a showdown over the last crystal.

Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku (?????????? lit. "Goemon Sugoroku of Mononoke?) is a video game for the Nintendo 64, released in 1999. The game is based on the Ganbare Goemon series and despite the series' relative popularity in the west for the system, the game was released only in Japan.

The game itself copies off the Japanese board game Sugoroku, populated with Konami's array of Ganbare Goemon characters. Up to four players control two dice, and take it in turns to control Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae over prerendered boards that resemble previous locations in the Ganbare Goemon series.

Goemon's Great Adventure
Platform: Nintendo 64

Release Year: 1999
Developer: Konami Computer Entertainment
Publisher: Konami
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Mystical Ninja 2 - Starring Goemon
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Goemon's Great Adventure is a side scrolling platform game in which players navigate stages. Gameplay in Great Adventure more closely resembles that of the Ganbare Goemon series' Super Famicom entries, and abandons the free-roaming style of Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon. Although movement is restricted along a two-dimensional plane, the stages are rendered in three dimensions and frequently wind along the z coordinate—earning the game 2.5D status similar to Yoshi's Story and the Super Smash Bros. series. The game begins on a world map upon which several circles are placed indicating stages. Players must complete certain stages to open up paths to others, and each world map generally features one town and one dungeon. Completing a dungeon allows travel to a new world map, but the player must collect several entry passes to gain access to these structures. Passes are rewarded for completing stages and performing tasks for non-player characters in cities. Though the game is linear like its 16-bit predecessors, certain non-linear elements exist—such as a secret village and multiple paths through a world map.


Goemon's Great Adventure takes place in a fantastical version of Edo period Japan, featuring forests, mountains, dwellings, and underworlds designed with Japanese themes and a touch of science fiction.[2] Individual stages are populated by monsters, obstacles, items (such as Ryo currency or dumplings), and occasionally bosses, who are stronger than most enemies. Players can run, jump, attack with weapons, and use various special abilities to reach the end of levels and gain entry passes. Four characters with three uniforms are available for play, including Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke, and Yae. Characters can be changed in cities or in stages through portals to an interdimensional tea house.[6] Two players can play the game simultaneously, though they must both be visible on screen—one player cannot advance if the other runs in a different direction. In each stage, a bar at the bottom of the screen displays information concerning character health, weapon equipped, lives remaining, and time of day. If a character is touched or attacked by a monster, a health bar is reduced from a total of three. If all bars disappear, the player loses a life and must restart the stage. The game ends if all lives are lost, at which point it reverts to the beginning or the last point at which the player saved his or her progress with a Controller pak. Defeated monsters sometimes leave behind dumplings and Maneki Neko—the former replenishes health, and the latter upgrades weapons up to two levels above starting strength.

Goemon's Great Adventure also features a system of day and night. Every two to three minutes, a meter in the information bar will slowly turn to evening or morning; the sky in a stage's background will similarly emulate the hues of sunset or sunrise. At night, more powerful and swift enemies challenge players.[2] However, they produce two Ryo coins rather than one when killed. Different non-playable characters can be found at night in towns as well. Within these cities, players can purchase armor (represented by three blue bars), sleep in inns and eat in restaurants to recover strength, and perform miniature quests for entry passes. For example, the character Sasuke must help a man in Spook Village set off fireworks for a festival. Scripted events relating to the game's storyline also take place in dwellings, and occur elsewhere before characters assault dungeons or after these special stages have been completed. The successful infiltration of a dungeon often leads to a battle between three giant mecha robots. These conflicts pitch the player, controlling the robots Impact and Lady Impact, against a villain and his or her robot of choice. From the perspective of a cockpit behind Impact's eyes, players can punch, kick, grab, or fire nasal and beam weaponry at an enemy robot. Measures of health, enemy health, and ammunition are displayed in the cockpit. If the player's robot runs out of health, the game restarts at the beginning of the battle. To avoid this scenario, players can throw a baton to the other friendly robot; if it hits its mark, player perspective changes to the new robot who has his or her own health count. In two-player mode, one player waits while the other fights, and comes into play if the baton is passed. The penultimate conflict in the game is an Impact battle, and after winning a final fight in normal sidescrolling mode the player can witness the ending of the game.


Plot

Goemon and his friends must stop Ebisumaru's ancestor Bismaru, who plans to use one of the Old Wise Man's inventions in order to unleash another disaster. Specifically, the Old Wise Man (who has appeared in every game in the series) has created a "ghost return machine" that can bring the dead back to life. Bismaru is attempting to create an army of undead creatures for her master, Dochuki, the master of the underworld.[8] Enemies like ghosts, skeletons, and creatures from Japanese folklore have been unleashed and must be stopped.

Goemon and Ebisumaru then, will travel around five different worlds, starting from Edo. In the local town, "Lost'n Town", Sasuke will join them. Later they will reach the Edo Castle, where they will try to save Omitsu, the King and his daughter from the robot Impact, himself. As they realize Impact was hypnotized by Bismaru, the princess of Edo reveals that Bismaru was attempting to reach some island.

Eventually, Goemon and allies reach Tortoise Island and find their final partner, Yae, who provides Sasuke with a "diving device". After the team follows Bismaru to the second castle (with resembles the "Festival Temple Castle" from the previous game series, "Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon"), which contains a several underwater levels. After defeating Bismaru's robot again, Bismaru turns to disappear again.

A new neutral character appears, a mysterios female ghost named Susaku, who tells Goemon where Bismaru escaped: Mafu Island, an island full of undead, creepy and ghost creatures in middle of the lava. In the local town, Goemon meets the Wise Man again, who reveals Bismaru's plan of returning the evil king Dochuki to the human world again. The gang must head to the third castle just to realize that it's too late, and Dochuki is alredy alive.

Somehow, Goemon and his friends manage to get to the Underworld, where undead and ghost creatures reside managing to get to the Underworld Castle to destroy Wise Man's Machine. Unable to stop Bismaru again, Susaku appears again to give Goemon directions. This time, the scenario takes places in a Floating Island in the sky. Susaku also gives Goemon a container to catch Dochuki's soul.

The final castle, "Dream Castle", is a combination of the four previous castles, where the gang will find Susaku kidnapped by Dochuki, threatning them to kill her if they don't give him the container. Goemon does so, having no option, and Dochuki breaks it with his hands.

Impact and Dochuki's evil ghost-robot get into a fight. Eventually, Impact wins, and what appears to be the final encounter is a fight between Dochuki and Goemon. After being defeated, Dochuki shows his real form, a giant wolf which spits poisonous gas.

Dochuki is beatened and tries to escapes, as there is no container to catch him, but Ebisumaru "farts" and kills Dochuki's spirit, as Ebisumaru's gas mixed with the spirit.

After the game is completed, Wise Man calls Goemon's gang to thank and tell them that he invented a new and more powerful machine to resurect the dead, again. Suddenly, a baby appears from nowhere, and Ebisumaru claims that it's from him. Bismaru appears and manages to kidnap the time machine again.

As in previous Ganbare Goemon games, the plot is wacky and lighthearted. Nintendo wrote that Goemon seems "at ease roaming a medieval Japan bustling with robots, DJs, space ships and extra-hold mousse.

GoldenEye 007
Platform: Nintendo 64

Genre: Shooter > First Person
Release Year: 1997
Developer: Rare
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: 007 GOLDENEYE

Storyline

Like the movie, GoldenEye 007 starts in Arkhangelsk, Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has uncovered a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond is sent to infiltrate the facility by bungee jumping from the dam, then join his friend and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan in destroying the factory. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an airplane.

The following missions depict 007's investigation of the satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work, a location he did not visit in the film. Entirely new to the game is the "Silo" mission in which Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in Kyrgyzstan, believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse (EMP) at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range; from its orbit, it would be a threat to any city on Earth. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Soviet troops. He defeats the troops, but Ourumov escapes.

Bond's visit to Monte Carlo and investigation of the frigate La Fayette and the Eurocopter Tiger (referred to as the "Pirate" in the game) were featured in the film, but here they are expanded, with Bond rescuing several hostages inside the ship and planting a tracker bug on the helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova — this meeting takes place much earlier than in the film. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP.

As in the film, Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet the chief of the Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan — his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. The player must escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya and communicate with Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery.

Natalya is captured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase (he can use a tank as in the movie, though he has the option not to) through the streets of Saint Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus — the player must destroy its weaponry stores, then hitch a ride on Trevelyan's Soviet missile train. This section features many departures from the film storyline, where Bond does not reach the depot, and only enters the train after stopping it with the tank. Bond makes his way through the train, killing Ourumov and rescuing Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.

Natalya accompanies Bond to the Caribbean. Surveying the Cuban jungle aerially, their light aircraft is shot down. Unscathed, Bond and Natalya perform a ground search of the area's heavily guarded jungle terrain, but are ambushed by Xenia, who is quickly killed by Bond. Bond sneaks Natalya into the control center to disrupt transmissions to the GoldenEye satellite and force it to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. An original mission shows Bond following the fleeing Trevelyan through a series of flooded caverns, which conceal a satellite dish under water. He then arrives at the antenna of the control centre's radio telescope. Trevelyan attempts to re-align it in a final attempt to restore contact with the GoldenEye. Bond destroys machinery vital to controlling the dish and kills Trevelyan in a firefight below the dish.



Development

GoldenEye 007 was originally announced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System before being stepped up to the Nintendo 64. The intention for the first few months of development was for the game to be an on-rails shooter similar to Virtua Cop; it only became a traditional free movement first-person shooter later in development. The development team working on GoldenEye 007 was inexperienced; for all but two of them, the project was their first game. As David Doak explained, "Looking back, there are things I'd be wary of attempting now, but as none of the people working on the code, graphics, and game design had worked on a game before, there was this joyful naïvete."

The game is based upon the GoldenEye film, but, as game designer Martin Hollis explained, many of the missions were extended or modified to allow the player to participate in sequences of which Bond was not originally a part, or those in which he only played a minor role. The original sets that were created for the film were first converted into complete, believable environments by one group of game designers; when this process was complete, other designers began populating them with objectives, characters and obstacles in order to create a balanced and fun game. According to Martin Hollis, "many of the levels in the game have a realistic and non-linear feel. There are rooms with no direct relevance to the level. There are multiple routes across the level." Hollis also noted that the concept of several varied objectives within each level was inspired by the multiple tasks in each stage of Super Mario 64.

The development team visited the studios of the Goldeneye film to collect blueprints, diagrams, and photographs of settings used in the film. The development team then created wireframe models of the settings with the NINGEN development software, Nintendo's development software for the N64, and SGI computers. Then the team added textures; some textures originated from digital photographs of the film sets.

GoldenEye was developed through two and a half years, but, according to Martin Hollis, only the last year was spent developing the game. During the beginning, the engine was built, art assets were made, and the enemy AI was written and polished. The game was delayed numerous times, partly due to the multiplayer mode; The team decided to incorporate it late in the development process, to demonstrate the N64's 4-player capabilities. Martin Hollis noted that the setting was "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." In addition to the N64 game, a version of GoldenEye was in development for the Virtual Boy, but was cancelled before release. The game was released in North America on 25 August, 1997, and had an initial $69.95 USD Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price in that territory.

Gameplay

GoldenEye 007's menu system is presented as an MI6 dossier. Four save files are available to track the player's progress through the game's twenty missions, each of which may be played on "Agent", "Secret Agent" or "00-Agent" difficulty settings, with higher difficulties requiring the player to complete additional and more complex objectives. M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny provide background information on the chosen mission and its goals.

Once a mission is completed, the player may either continue progressing through the story or choose to replay a previously completed level. Completing certain missions within particular target times enables the player to unlock bonus cheat options which make various changes to the graphics and gameplay, and upon fully completing the game on the 00-Agent difficulty level, an additional "007" setting allows the player to customize the challenge of any mission. When a player chooses the "007" setting, they are presented with a screen entitled 'SPECIAL OPTIONS:'. There are four options on adjustable horizontal bars. The 'Enemy health' and 'Enemy damage' can be adjusted between 0 and 1000%. The 'Enemy accuracy' and 'Enemy reaction speed' can be adjusted between 0 and 100%.

The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK, called the PP7 ingame. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts (although their names are altered), while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as rate of fire and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit. There are no health-increasing pickups in the game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a second health bar. Stealth is an important element of the game: in order to avoid gunfights with multiple opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons may be powerful enough to shoot through doors and helmets but are very loud, while others incorporate suppressor or telescopic sight attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly. Also, hiding behind doors and columns is often necessary.

Some gadgets from the James Bond film series are featured in the game and are often used to complete particular mission objectives; for example, 007's in-game watch includes the laser from the GoldenEye film, the remote mine detonator from GoldenEye and Moonraker, and the electromagnet from Live and Let Die.


Citadel

GameShark users found several text references to a level called "Citadel" in the game. Rare explained its nature, and joked about players' speculation that multiplayer-mode Bond characters could be seen in the single-player game: "'Citadel' was a very rough test level designed during the early stages of multiplayer mode. It is not in the finished game in any shape or form, and Oddjob and Mayday would not be in it if it was."

In 2005, the website GoldenEye Forever revealed that it was possible to access a fully playable multiplayer version by linking a GameShark to a computer. The codes to access Citadel in its fullest state totaled nearly 10,000 lines. The test map is largely a mass of shapes and ramps that the players can climb upon, thus giving players many opportunities for sniping and hiding.

GE:X Patch 3a: 02-26-11

This is the third official, full-point release, of GoldenEye: X. Over the last few months, we've been busy adding in new content, as well as addressing certain issues that cropped up in the most recent versions of the game. We've not only been focusing our efforts on the multiplayer 'Virtual Reality' aspect of the game, but have also made advances with the mission campaign. However, we're still not quite at the point where those are good enough to be made public. In the meantime, you can play solo (or co-op) against up to eight Simulants in any of the VR levels available. Here is a summary of the edits and updates in this version...

a. There is a lot more available to the player from the very start of a new file. From Virtual Reality, you should have access to every weapon, weapon set, music track, scenario, game option, and Simulant type (with the ability to use up to eight).

b. Two new levels are available in VR... Bunker ii and Archives. They are (mostly) complete with glass, doors, metal crates, and all the weapons you can handle. The Simulants perform very well, and are able to fully traverse the stages. The only hiccup lies in the metal crates. They'll eventually drop through the floor after being destroyed and disappear for the remainder of the match. It may take a few cycles for it to happen, however.

c. There's a very special treat in this release. Expertly ported from The World Is Not Enough on the N64, the "Labyrinth" multiplayer map by Zoinkity. He's brought this fun level over to GoldenEye, which was then converted for Perfect Dark and updated to have more spawns, additional ammo crates, Capture the Flag bases, and even five Hills. It's a brand new experience for those not familiar with TWINE, and a great bit of nostalgia for those who are.

d. Get your hands on some new hardware! Take out your opponents in stealth by using the silenced variations of the PP7 Special Issue and D5K Deutsche. The destructive Shotgun is also now at your disposal. Like some of the other weapon ports, the muzzle flashes and bullet origins aren't perfect, but the weapons themselves and their positioning matches the originals. Once we learn more about how the weapons in PD are setup, these issues will be taken care of.

e. An additional eight bodies and five heads have been added to the character roster. Choose from the Russian Soldier, Jungle Commando, Siberian Guard (Black) [which also completes Mishkin], or Siberian Special Forces. Feeling invincible? Than select Boris as your on-screen persona. Want to use some voodoo magic against your foes? Baron Samedi is just waiting to put on a hex. And whether you're tall or short, there's somebody for you. Jaws and Oddjob, the polar-opposites in GE, are ready to duke it out again... whether you want your friends to use them or not is up to you.

f. From the first patch, the Moonraker Elite has been using a customized arm/hand model. Since then, the other characters have been matched up with more appropriate models. Most of those have also been customized, since PD only offered so many styles. There's a couple that still require better textures, but the majority of characters are complete.

g. Simulants are now fully supported in the Caves map. Thanks to a base AI Path Network created by Octan Baron for his custom mission in GoldenEye, Sims are capable of navigating all areas of the stage. Hopefully this will breath new life into a level that most would consider to be the least appealing multiplayer choice in GoldenEye.

h. Egyptian has seen some architectural modification since the last release. There are three chutes that normally contain ceiling-mounted drone guns in the mission. They have been edited and changed into ramps. It was a decision made to better performance, for both humans and Sims. Before, people were capable of falling through the lower edge of the chute and dying. As a ramp, this occurance is eliminated. Simulants now use these ramps without any issues.

i. The left-handed Phantom and Sniper Rifle now draw correctly, and not inside-out. Their bullet origins are still inaccurate, but the Phantom does have a slightly improved muzzle flare. It also uses the appropriate sound effect, and has been adjusted to better replicate the original. The Sniper Rifle has also been slightly modified, and now deals the same amount of damage as in GoldenEye.

j. The AR33 Assault Rifle and RC-P90 are now capable of penetrating through objects and characters. I'm not sure why they weren't setup by Rare to do this in the first place, but it has since been fixed.

k. Certain doors in various levels weren't using the proper flag to prevent them from being seen through walls. Those that appeared in Temple, Facility and Egyptian are now all taken care of. Others also close portals when shut, which may help slightly with the framerate in certain areas.

l. The glass in Facility is now, once again, indestructible. You may still fire through the glass with a weapon capable of penetrating through objects, so beware of Sims who are packing an AR33 or RC-P90.

m. Two songs have been removed and replaced in the Virtual Reality soundtrack list. Silo X didn't loop, and once finished, would continue on in silence. The End Credits theme was taken out, since it was never included in the original game's multiplayer soundtrack. Both Elevator songs (from Control and Caverns) have been included as their replacements.

n. For those of you who are able to play this game on console, through the use of a backup device, you'll be pleased to hear that both Complex and Egyptian no longer crash during loading. There was an error in the background file that didn't seem to cause any problems via emulation, but wasn't nearly as kind on the actual hardware. Both files have been updated, and are confirmed to work on console. HOWEVER, it is recommended that you DO NOT use GoldenEye character bodies and heads. There is a bug that is causing the console to crash when they are loaded into the level. It might not happen right away, but it eventually rears its ugly head. Only a few heads have been confirmed to play properly, but none of the bodies. So, until this is sorted out, please stick to the Perfect Dark leftovers.

o. The Character Profiles & Other Information in the Information Room, as well as the Vehicles listed in the Hangar PC, have begun taking after their GoldenEye replacements. All of the characters (with exception to Ourumov and Valentin) are available to view, but the informative articles have yet to be dealt with. Also, most of the vehicles are still displaying the PD objects, and not all descriptions have been written. These things are being left in to demonstrate the progress we're making outside of Virtual Reality mode.

GE:X Patch 2a: 10-11-10

This is the first official update to the GoldenEye: X project. During the months that have passed since the first release, we've been working hard to include new and exciting content. There are three more levels to play in Virtual Reality mode (previously known as the Combat Simulator in Perfect Dark), updates to the already available maps, many more character bodies and heads, three additional weapons, and the actual GoldenEye soundtrack. Sims can now navigate the entire Egyptian Temple, and are fully supported in the Temple. You may also notice a few other subtle changes here and there. For more details on what's in the game, please browse the list below the written paragraphs. Though we'd love to include more in this release, it's certainly about time that an update be issued. Those of us working on GE:X sincerely hope that you enjoy this current version, and will continue to check back for updates in the future.

GE:X Patch 1a: 03-28-10

This is the very first preview release of the GoldenEye porting project. The end goal is to take everything from GoldenEye and put it into Perfect Dark. Why, you ask? Because the Perfect Dark engine is an enhanced version of GE's. Many new things are possible running on this engine.

Combat Simulator offers players a chance to play what would normally be considered multiplayer mode all by themselves - against computer controlled opponents. New scenarios are available, such as: King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Hacker Central and Pop a Cap. PD even allows for better customization of player settings. Characters can also have heads swapped, so nothing can prevent you from using the Terrorist's head on Boris' body. If all of the excellent features that the Combat Simulator has to offer isn't enough, think about some of the great upgrades that could be made to missions...

Weather elements, suns and moons, interactive lighting, guards who can see through and over railings, character speech and voice overs, and many others. Want to play with a friend? No problem! Both Co-operative and Counter-Operative modes are accessible.

It's going to take time, but hopefully this preview will be enough to demonstrate just how awesome an already incredible game could become. This is GoldenEye... like you've never experienced it before.

notes:
You may notice these heads appearing throughout the missions. However, they are not currently setup to wear sunglasses. They will also sit on any PD bodies strangely, being much lower down toward the chest. This is just how the GE heads behave with the PD bodies, so give it a laugh and don't worry about it.

Known Bugs / Glitches...

GE vs. PD Heads:
Putting a head from one game onto the body from another usually results in floating or sinking heads. This is just the way the games set things up, so there is no way around it.

GoldenEye Firearms:
There's some issues with these. They use the wrong crosshairs, some have funky coloured tracers, sims may have difficulty operating them under certain circumstances, and the newly ported guns need their muzzle flash relocated. The handguns aren't as noticable, but you'll see it with the Phantom and Shotgun. Because of re-ordering, some of the PD weapons are now in the old Classic slots. As a result, they can't be used by sims and also have their secondary functions locked out.

Simulants:
I've allowed simulants to spawn into each of the maps, but they won't function in them all. Since the first release, the Temple and Caves have been updated with path networks. This means that Simulants can now freely roam the stages. Also, the Egyptian network has been extended and tweaked, allowing Sims to access the "Golden Gun" room, and better use the long stairwells and ramps. The Complex does have a path network constructed for it, but there are some issues that weren't resolved prior to the second official patch release. I've done all I could, and it does perform well enough for now. If I can get this fixed before the third official release, there will be a corrective update issued.

Caves:
There's a portal error between rooms 08 and 09, which is due to overlapping architecture. They set a special flag for it in GoldenEye, but it doesn't seem to work in Perfect Dark. Hopefully we'll be able to force the two rooms to be lit at the same time and prevent this from occuring in the next update.

Headers/Dividers:
Because I wanted to have everything (or mostly everything) unlocked from the start of the game for new users, some of the menu headers and dividers may be missing. The rely on certain flags to be set in order to be shown. I think I fixed it everywhere, but don't be surprised if something seems off.

Hangar Information PC:
The computer stationed in the Carrington Institute hangar will often crash the game. If you attempt to preview any of the files stored on the PC, the gameplay may freeze and you'll be forced to restart. I'm not sure why this happens at this time, so you'll just have to avoid it for now.

Genre: Simulation
Release Year: 1998
Developer: Toy Box Studios, Victor Interactive Software
Publisher: Natsume Co., Ltd
Players: Single-player

Gameplay

The objective of Harvest Moon 64 is to restore and maintain an abandoned farm. The player is initially given a set of tools to use in order to achieve this goal. Along with restoring the farm, there are a number of other side quests that the player may choose to partake in, including training and racing a horse, selling crops, participating in a variety of town festivals as well as random events, falling in love and getting married, collecting recipes, and collecting photographs from various achievements and events.

The player starts out with the bare minimum features for the farm: A small house, a shipping bin, a barn for sheep and cows, a coop for chickens, a silo, a shed, and farm land. Along the way, the player has the opportunity to upgrade tools, add extensions to the house, fill the barn and coop, and cover his farmland with flowers, grass, and crops. The local town, where most of the villagers spend their day, contains a church, a bar, a bakery, a town square, a flower shop, a library, a tool shop, among other things.

Unlike the original Harvest Moon for the SNES, there is a limited amount of time to work in any given day as well as a limited amount of stamina for work. Many game features, such as character locations and whether shops are open or closed, depends on what time and day it is. Each season lasts 30 days and has different weather patterns, crops to grow, and wild herbs available.

Hexen
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Shooter > First Person
Release Year: 1997
Developer: Software Creations
Publisher: id Software
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Plot

Following the tale of D'Sparil's defeat in Heretic, Hexen takes place in another realm, Cronos, which is besieged by the second of the Serpent Riders, Korax. Three heroes set out to destroy Korax. The player assumes the role of one such hero.

Gameplay

A new series feature introduced in Hexen is the choice of character class. Players may choose to play as a fighter, cleric, or mage. Each character has unique weapons and physical characteristics, lending an additional degree of variety and replay value to the gameplay. The Fighter relies mainly on close quarter martial attacks with weapons both mundane and magical in nature, and is tougher and faster than the other characters. The Mage uses an assortment of long-range spells, whose reach is counterbalanced by the fact that he is the most fragile and slowest moving of the classes. The Cleric arms himself with a combination of both melee and ranged capabilities, being a middle ground of sorts between the other two classes. Additionally, certain items behave differently when collected and used by each of the classes, functioning in a manner better suiting their varying approach to combat, further differentiating the three.

Hexen introduces "hub" levels to the series, wherein the player travels back and forth between central hub levels and connected side levels. This is done in order to solve larger-scale puzzles that require a series of items or switches to be thrown. The player must traverse through a hub in order to reach a boss and advance 
to the next hub.



Development

Hexen uses a modified version of the Doom engine, which allows jumping, network play with up to 8 players and the choice of three character classes. It also popularised the "hub system" of level progression in the genre of first-person shooter games. Unlike previous games, which had relied purely on General MIDI for music, Hexen is also able to play tracks from CDs. The game's own CD contained soundtrack in audio format that was exactly the same as the game's MIDI soundtrack but played through a high quality sound module. However, the most significant improvement was the addition of wall translation, rotation and level scripting.

Hey You, Pikachu!
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Simulation
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Ambrella
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: 1
Alternate Title: Pikachu Genki Dechu
_________________________
*
Description

For the first time ever, you can actually talk to your favorite Pokemon. Tag along with Pikachu as it goes through its daily routines, taking field trips, going fishing and having picnics, becoming better friends with each passing day. Pikachu will hear and react to the words you say. The more you speak the closer friends you'll be!


Gameplay

The game begins when the main character is asked to try out a new device of Professor Oak's that is used to talk to Pokémon. The player soon meets a wild Pikachu and befriends it. The Pikachu's trust must be earned by the player and eventually it will come and live in the player's house. There are three different activity days: Pikachu's Daring Days, Discovery Days, and Play Days. Each day has a different objective (e.g. collecting food, going fishing) and the player can earn Pika Points, which is the currency used at Abra's Shop to unlock new items.

Eventually, if the player reaches day 365, Professor Oak appears and says that Pikachu has to be released, as it is a wild Pokémon. The player has to go to the woods where Pikachu was found and say "goodbye" several times, upon which Pikachu realizes he can't live with the player anymore, and, sadly, leaves. After the credits, while the player is looking around the front yard and reminiscing about Pikachu, it returns, and the game continues as if Pikachu was never released.


Development

In reference to Nintendo's rivalry with Sony, an easter egg was placed in the game: speaking "PlayStation" into the microphone causes Pikachu to become angry

Info

Hey You, Pikachu!, known in Japan as Pikachu Genki dechu (????????????, lit. a pun on "Pikachu genki desu" (Pikachu is fine).?), is a Nintendo 64 video game developed by Ambrella and published by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan on December 12, 1998, and in North America on November 6, 2000.

The game features voice-recognition technology used to talk to Pikachu, the star of the game. It is one of only two games that utilizes the N64's Voice Recognition Unit (VRU), a piece of hardware that can comprehend and analyze the human voice. However, It is the only game released in the United States to use the VRU. Similar technology has been subsequently built into the Nintendo DS and used in Gamecube games such as Mario Party 6. The player can move around and pick up items, in addition to speaking with Pikachu and can describe everything.

Media: Cartridge
Genre: Racing
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Stormfront Studios
Publisher: Electronic Arts
Players: Single-player, multiplayer

Gameplay

The focus of the game is racing one of a selection of cars through various themed tracks. Secret tracks can be accessed by winning and new cars can be used by finding the 'new car' bonuses hidden in each stage.

As seen in the hint screens, using the controller to perform various stunts from jumping off points gains 'turbos' which allow short bursts of speed. The car in use will take damage based on running into obstacles or other players. Icons found around the track give differing performance enhancements.

The game requires a memory card in order to save progress.




The Nintendo 64 version includes six songs, though each of them have been reduced in length and are almost entirely without vocals. The sound quality for these music tracks have also been downgraded and are slightly muffled. This version is also missing the song from Metallica. This version does include the many voice clips that are played when a player executes a stunt. Also, this version uses Anti-Aliasing so the graphics are smooth and most of the polygon tearing has been eliminated. In addition, this version has slightly less pop-up and a slightly improved draw-in distance, and so the player is able to see a bit more in the distance.

Hybrid Heaven
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Action > Role Playing Game
Release Year: 1999
Developer: KCE Osaka
Publisher: Konami
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Plot

Players assume the role of Mr. Diaz, a synthetic human hybrid created by aliens. In the game's introduction, he turns on his masters when he kills a synthetic human intended to replace the President's bodyguard, Johnny Slater. Diaz finds himself in a massive underground installation created by the aliens under Manhattan. As the game progresses, it is revealed that the player is actually assuming the role of Slater, who was disguised as Diaz by the Gargatuans. The Gargatuans are an alien race around three feet tall who, after being betrayed by a member of their species who awoke from hypersleep and piloted the ship to Earth, are forced to help said traitor with his genetic experiments. The alien creates clones and hybrids (a genetic mix of human and Gargatuan DNA, resulting in extra-powerful creatures) and intends to conquer the earth through a replacement of its leaders, beginning with the United States. A few Gargatuans have escaped the traitor, and conduct a underground resistance in the woodwork. They found Johnny after he had been cloned and disguised him as Diaz, who they incapacitated and kept unconscious. Johnny regains his memories, which were blocked while he was disguised. The player then must travel even further down the bunker in the hopes of stopping the aliens from replacing the president with a clone and by request of the Gargatuans to defeat the traitor. Johnny's personal motive to help him stay focused is that he must make it back in time to meet his girlfriend under the Christmas Tree in Times Square.

Enemies included clones (unremarkable creations, created mainly for menial labor), agents (resemble the public perception of the secret service, men in black suits with sunglasses), mutants (genetic experiments that resulted in vicious creatures, presumably for military use. When one mutant was released early in the game, it killed several technicians before you finally killed it), robots (mostly humanoid, but some were straight-out mechs), and Hybrids. One Hybrid, created to replace the Secretary of Defense (or possibly State), is Johnny's antagonist for much of the game, before a final showdown wherein the alien creature explains much of the plot.



Gameplay

Hybrid Heaven takes many elements from standard 3-D action-adventure games, such as Tomb Raider. The player can move in any direction, jump, crawl, climb, and shoot. The player must solve puzzles by disabling electronic weapons or through skillful manoeuvering.

However, when battling a monster (called a "biological weapon" in Hybrid Heaven), the game switches to a completely different mode. The player is constrained to a small room and can no longer jump, crawl, or climb. The monster and the player move around for strategic position in the room. When they are close enough, and have built up enough energy, one or the other will decide to attack. At that point time freezes and a single round similar to an RPG turn ensues: the attacker picks an attack from a list, the defender picks a defense, and the results are displayed. After the attack, both monster and player return to jockeying for position in realtime. All of this can happen within seconds, which keeps the action flowing more naturally than in most RPGs. Because of this, the Vs. Battle Mode plays very much like a regular 3D fighting game, with the unique RPG element. In addition to regular punching, kicking, and grappling attacks, energy can be saved up to 5 times to allow for Combos. Combos are achieved by either the player editing their own during a fight (one move at a time), or by choosing preset or saved combos.

The battle system of Hybrid Heaven has a strong emphasis on leveling up, which is another hallmark of RPGs.[citation needed] Experience using an offense or a defense directly correlates with the player's statistical abilities when performing that move in the future. Hybrid Heaven even goes to the extreme of having separate statistics for each limb, the torso, and the head.

The game includes Rumble Pak and Expansion Pak support.

Hydro Thunder
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Racing > Boats
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Midway San Diego
Publisher: Midway Games
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Gameplay

The gameplay of Hydro Thunder consists of racing high-tech speedboats through treacherous environments, from the cold seas of the Arctic Circle, to a post-apocalyptic, flooded version of New York City.


Scattered across the tracks are blue and red boost icons. When touched these icons allow the player who touched them to boost. Red boost icons are more scarce than blue boost icons due to the fact red boost icons give more boost fuel. When a player has boost fuel they may use the boost button to boost, which allows a player's boat to reach speeds much higher than what would normally be possible. Also by boosting a player can knock other boats into the air, a feature described by the game as the Mighty Hull. Another aspect of boosting is the Hydro Jump which is performed by braking and using the boost button. When combined with the many ramps on the tracks, players can reach short cuts and boost icons that would normally not be accessible otherwise.

The boats in Hydro Thunder are divided into 4 categories: easy, medium, hard and bonus. The easy boats tend to be easy to control but they do not have the speed of other classes. Medium boats are in the middle, and Hard boats are usually very difficult to control but are very fast. Bonus boats are accessible by entering a combination to access the boat. The tracks in Hydro Thunder like the boats are divided into four classes: easy, medium, hard and bonus. The easy tracks are usually short and easy with the bonus tracks being the longest and hardest. The arcade version of the game had only two bonus tracks, New York Disaster and Nile Adventure. Hydro Speedway was present as a hidden track. The console versions added two more, Catacomb and Castle Von Dandy, making four in all.

Iggy's Reckin' Balls is a simple racing game with tower-based levels. Each type of stage is divided into 10 towers. The players race up the tower and the first to reach the top is teleported back to the bottom. Once two or three laps (or just one in final towers in each world) have been completed, the tower is destroyed and the player moves on to the next tower.

Iggy's Reckin' Balls is a video game that was developed exclusively for the Nintendo 64 console by Iguana Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment in August 1998. It involves a set of ball characters with faces and unique personalities that race around a series of vertical obstacle courses in order to win medals. The characters use grappling hooks to climb to other platforms and attack other players. Power-ups are scattered throughout the 100 courses, which equip the players with temporary special abilities. Up to four players can participate. Modes of play include Arcade, Mix-up, Time Trial and Battle. There are a total of eight characters to choose from immediately, with an additional nine hidden characters that can be unlocked later. The game is named after Iggy, who is the main character. Iggy represents the developer's mascot, an iguana.

Plot

The story of the game is set in 1947 and depicts archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones returning to his digging career after the turbulent World War II conflicts he was involved in. Sophia Hapgood, an old friend of Indy and now a member of the Central Intelligence Agency, visits him at his dig site in the Canyonlands and informs him that the Russians are excavating the ruins of Babylon. Led by Dr. Gennadi Volodnikov, a physicist interested in alternate dimensions, the operation's supposed objective is to find a weapon more powerful than the atom bomb, giving the Soviets a deciding advantage in the Cold War.

She hires Indy to investigate what exactly they are searching for, and he travels to the Russian dig site in Iraq. There, he joins up with Sophia's boss Simon Turner and finds out that Volodnikov is looking for the Babylonian god Marduk who lives on another plane called the Aetherium. Deep in the ruins of the Etemenanki, Indy translates some ancient tablets with cuneiform writing explaining the true story behind the Tower of Babel: 2600 years ago, King Nebuchadnezzar II was inspired by Marduk to build a great engine, but the frightened Babylonians tore the tower housing it down, leading four of the god's disciples to escape with some parts of this "Infernal Machine".


Gameplay

Infernal Machine is an action-adventure and, as such, a hybrid of various gameplay mechanics. The player sees Indiana Jones from a third-person perspective and controls him through 17 levels of a fully polygonal 3D world. A recurring element of the title are the platforming sections, for which a combination of running, jumping, climbing, and the use of the protagonist's trademark bullwhip is required. Furthermore, several human, animal and supernatural enemies are encountered during the course of the game, which the player can fight off with numerous firearms, the aforementioned whip, and a machete. In addition to these obstacles, the game largely focuses on solving puzzles and discovering treasures in the levels, the latter of which sometimes include vehicle-themed portions such as rafting, jeep treks, and mine cart chases. The main objective of the game is to collect four machine parts in order to complete the titular Infernal Machine.

    Training: practice of shooting free kicks and corner kicks with a selected team.



Trivia

    Although line-ups were to reflect 1998 FIFA World Cup squads, there are some inconsistencies. For example, players named "Revameli" (representing Fabrizio Ravanelli for Italy), "Lomalio" (representing Romario for Brazil), "Leos" (representing Adolfo Ríos for Mexico) or "Bu" (representing Ibrahim Ba for France) did not participate in the final tournament.
    During the International Cup mode ball turns colour to blue which resembles the ball used in the 1998 FIFA World Cup - Tricolore
    It is impossible to lose the match by accumulating too many red cards in the PS1 version. After the third red card only yellows are shown. This does not apply to the N64 version, where having five red cards in a single match (and thus, less than seven players on pitch, per rule) results in an automatic loss.
    Some players in the game of both qualified and non-qualified teams had initially retired for their team one year before the 1998 World Cup. For example, Colin Miller (Biller), Randy Samuel (Zamual) of Canada and Carlos Hermosillo (Hermosio) of Mexico had retired from international football in 1997.
    Unlike it's PlayStation 1 counterpart, the edit mode is limited to only typing 8 characters.
    Winning the International Cup competition allows the player to use unusual hairstyles in the create player mode.
    Winning the International League competition unlocks European, African, Asian, American and World 'Elite' teams that can be played in the exhibition match mode.
    Due to a number of programming flaws, goal scoring becomes highly probable in certain situations. If the direction of the ball can be changed after the goalkeeper has started his 'save' animation, he will be forced to complete that animation before producing a save that will prevent a goal.
    The goalkeeper will never move closer to his posts. He always stays in the centre of the goal.
    The C-left button is used to trap the ball, but by holding the button down the on-field player will juggle the ball endlessly.
    Commentary on the English version is provided by Tony Gubba. Like its predecessor, the commentary on ISS 98 is (perhaps intentionally) comical, with Gubba providing questionable analysis of the action, for instance exclaiming "surely that had to be a penalty!" for an infringement nowhere near the penalty area, or "good tackle!", when a player is recklessly barged to the floor using the 'hack' (A+B) move.

Series

The series had its origins with the NES platform, late in 1991 with Konami Hyper Soccer, Konami's first soccer game on consoles. Although technically not a game in the series, the success of the game was enough for Konami start developing Jikkyo World Soccer: Perfect Eleven for the Japanese Super NES, released as International Superstar Soccer for the rest of the world, both in 1994. An improved version, Jikkyo World Soccer 2: Fighting Eleven (worldwide, International Superstar Soccer Deluxe) was released one year later, and saw a Mega Drive / Genesis version in 1996. These 16-bit titles, in many terms, were one step ahead from other contemporary football games, including FIFA International Soccer:

    Instead of tiny, super deformed players on pitch, player sprites had an adult look to them;
    The players looked all alike, only changing hair and skin color from team to team. ISS players had distinctive looks, corresponding to real-life players of the time: the Swedish forward Magnus, is Martin Dahlin, the Argentine Fuerte is Claudio Caniggia while Capitale is Gabriel Batistuta, the Italian Galfano is Roberto Baggio while Carboni is Ravanelli;[citation needed][original research?]
    This was the first football game to ever show back numbers on the jersey for each player (though the keeper's jersey always showed a number 1, independent of his assigned number);[citation needed]
    The adult look given to players made their animation quite real, instead of the rather cartoonish way shown before (like the players jumping in slow-motion in FIFA IS), thus turning playability more fluid[citation needed];
    The game was the first to feature play-by-play commentary (more frequent in the Japanese versions);[citation needed] previously, the announcer's voice could only be heard shouting "goal", and it was not present in every game.[citation needed]

In 1995, the first KCET title, Winning Eleven was developed for the PlayStation (Goal Storm internationally) and in 1996, Jikkyo J-League: Perfect Striker made its debut on the Nintendo 64 (re-used worldwide in 1997 as International Superstar Soccer 64 with international teams instead of J-League). In 1997 and 1998 there were several titles released, including the second and third versions of Winning Eleven (which included a fully-licensed release for the 1998 World Cup), but the first major in Europe since ISS Deluxe was International Superstar Soccer 98 for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the best titles for the console[citation needed], and one of the highest selling third party titles.[citation needed]

By the turn of the century, KCET's Winning Eleven titles were improving considerably over KCEO's titles[citation needed], and in 2000 ISS Pro Evolution was released worldwide. The last title for the Nintendo 64 was International Superstar Soccer 2000, based on Jikkyo J-League: Perfect Striker 2, and when ISS Pro Evolution 2 was released in 2001 and followed by the first Pro Evolution Soccer, there wasn't much room for the Jikkyou World Soccer/International Superstar Soccer series, although three ISS titles were released, the last (ISS 3, in 2003) for the first time was released for personal computers. There were also three Game Boy Advance versions, one of them based on ISS Deluxe.

Gameplay

In essence, the game is quite the same as its Super NES predecessor, International Superstar Soccer Deluxe, vastly upgraded for the Nintendo 64, with 3D animation, fluid and fast-paced gameplay. While it kept largely the same team roster (with the teams now sporting near-authentic kits), South Africa debuted in this game as a selectable side, replacing Morocco. However, the Japanese version of ISS 64 has teams that are not present in the overseas versions, such as Bolivia, Yugoslavia, Canada and Saudi Arabia.

There are six game modes, including a fun multiplayer 1-4 player (except for everyone's icons being the same color) exhibition mode and training. International Cup has the player competing against a range of teams from around the world in a round robin tournament; World League is a series of 70 matches against every one of other teams in the game.

The player can also contest a penalty shoot-out competition with up to 4 players, or attempt to complete certain scenario games (where each game is set up with a specific goal, for example scoring a goal within a given time limit, or stopping

Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1
Platform: Nintendo 64
Genre: Sports > Fishing
Release Year: 2000
Developer: HAL Laboratory
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: Single Player
Alternate Title: BASS FISHING NO.1, SHIGESATO ITOI'S
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 is set on the fictional Akahoshi Lake (????) where the BAC (Bass Angler's Club) catch fish and compete in tournaments. There are several types of fish and there is a size-range within each type. The goal of the player is to catch the most and the largest fish possible as to compete in extra competitions such as quizzes. In order to have the greatest success in fishing, players must determine the most fruitful part of Lake Akahoshi given the weather conditions and the time of the day. The player is also able to select from a number of different lures that can be used to attract different species and different sizes of fish.[5] The most sought-after fish in the game is the "over 80cm Bass."

In January 1997, Nintendo in collaboration with St.GIGA held a series of multiplayer contests allowing players of the Satellaview version of the game to compete on a national scale. Itoi himself participated in this event. The Satellaview competition event was divided into two divisions. The top 10 best scores from the General Division as well as the top 20 best scores in the Knockout Division would win a collectible Bass Tsuri No.1-exclusive prize Lure. Each Lure was hand-painted and these prizes have become collectors items since the demise of the Satellaview. The top 100 best-scoring participants in both Divisions would additionally win Tournament original stickers, would have their names published on Nintendo's website, and would be listed in Satellaview enthusiast magazines of the time such as Bass Fishing No.1 Weekly Magazine (??????No.1?????). This competition proved highly successful and its popularity prompted Nintendo and St.GIGA to run a second competition between April 27 and May 3, 1997.

N64 version

In the 2000 Definitive Edition (for N64), a few changes have been made to give players a more in-depth playing experience. As such, support for a tackle-and-reel peripheral has been included to heighten gameplay realism. Force-feedback features have also been included to allow the controller (standard controller or tackle-and-reel) to vibrate realistically when a fish has been "hooked."[10] Between March 31 and May 31, 2000, another competition was launched by Nintendo in collaboration with Famitsu magazine to promote the Definitive Edition of the game. Winners of this competition could win a free reel-and-tackle controllers, original Bass Tsuri No.1-exclusive prize clothing, etc. By sending away for it, a select number of players could also win Bass Tsuri No.1-exclusive prize Lures.

Synopsis

Jet Force Gemini revolves around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the evil leader Mizar and his horde of Drones. Jet Force Gemini is composed of three main characters: Juno, a taciturn, somewhat melancholy human male whose parents were killed by space pirates that invaded his home station. He desires to protect his side of space and is frustrated with the Federation, since they apparently do not perceive Mizar as a viable threat; Vela, on the other hand, is Juno's feisty twin sister. She desires to stay strong and help her brother protect humanity's side of space, as she feels she must prove herself as a female in the "skeptical military world"; And Lupus, Jet Force Gemini's wardog mascot. As a cybernetically enhanced companion, Lupus is considered to be a vital member of the Jet Force Gemini team.

The game begins with the three characters in orbit around the planet Goldwood after barely escaping the destruction of the entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of Mizar. Their ship however, had suffered extraordinary damage, leaving them defenseless and unable to warp out of the system. It is not long before the team witnesses Mizar's attack on Goldwood, and soon afterwards, their cruiser is attacked by a large craft of Mizar's known as the Spawnship. Boarded by drones and out of time, they decide not to wait for orders and act on their own. The three decide to abandon the ship and go off on their own separate paths to stop the invasion and confront Mizar. Juno is the last off the ship, and, like the others, begins following a set path towards Mizar's Palace. As the game progresses, the heroes eventually find themselves reunited at Mizar's Palace—and face to face with Mizar himself.

Severely underestimating the power of two humans and their dog, Mizar is quickly overcome, and Jet Force Gemini appear to have done the impossible all too easily. However, Mizar, enraged and vowing revenge on the human race, escapes to a nearby asteroid where he sets course to impact with Earth. King Jeff, the beloved leader of the Tribals, quickly arranges a plan to help the heroes: by providing an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar's asteroid. Nevertheless, the team needs to locate several vital parts scattered throughout the galaxy, as well as rescue all the Tribals enslaved by Mizar. Also, King Jeff upgrades the heroes with new armor and jet packs that allow them to fly. From this point on, the team stays united and, together, works to search every world for anything they can find.

After all the Tribals are rescued and the parts found, the team, along with King Jeff, reassembles the old Tribal craft and quickly depart to save Earth. After a rough landing, Juno fights through Mizar's guards in an attempt to locate the tyrant. Eventually, Juno does find Mizar, and in front of a dramatic view of Earth, they clash in epic battle. Mizar does not go down easily this time, but indeed after a long struggle, Juno does defeat him. To the surprise of all though, Mizar is revealed to be a robot controlled by King Jeff's jealous brother, Barry. After realizing destroying Barry's robot ruined their best chance of destroying the asteroid, the team is out of options. In an honorable notion, Floyd, the quiet little robot that defected from Mizar and followed the team, offers to sacrifice himself to destroy the asteroid. Hesitantly, the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core. With no time to spare, the team returns to the Tribal craft and departs only seconds before Floyd reaches the core. In a brilliant flash of light, the asteroid is destroyed mere miles away from entering the atmosphere of Earth. Afterwards on Earth, Jet Force Gemini is given the highest honors for their many accomplishments


Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter video game developed and published by Rare. It was exclusively released for the Nintendo 64 in late 1999 in North America, Europe and Japan. Created by the same Rare team that developed Blast Corps, the title features elements that have never been seen on the Nintendo 64, such as a no split-screen co-operative mode and a control scheme that features two ways to play the game. Jet Force Gemini shares elements with platform games, action-adventure games, and run and gun games.

Players assume the role of three members of Jet Force Gemini, the last remaining group of the once proud and strong military organization Jet Force. The main story arc encompasses the trio's quest as they try to stop the advances of the dark insect tyrant Mizar and his near limitless army. Throughout the game, the player will also have to collect several spaceship parts and save a large number of Tribals, a group of survivors who have been enslaved and prisoned by Mizar.

Reviews were generally positive towards the game, though not as high as Rare's other N64 games such as GoldenEye 007 and Banjo-Kazooie. Praise was given to its graphics, sound and originality, while criticism was levelled at the game's difficult controls and insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the game. Jet Force Gemini is frequently regarded as one of the most innovative and original games of its era.

Description

Killer Instinct Gold rocks the gaming world with its earth-shattering moves and unbelievable graphics. Your battles unfold with lightning-fast action and fluid character animation at 60 frames per second. We faithfully duplicated all the features that made Killer Instinct 2 an arcade hit. We've even thrown in a complete training mode to school you on all the moves! The eye-popping graphics, the explosive hits and jaw-dropping combos make Killer Instinct Gold the only fighting game you'll ever want in your house!


More Story

Killer Instinct 2 follows on from the plot line that the previous installment ended with. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo. Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat, but Chief Thunder, Cinder and Riptor did not return. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.

Gameplay

As with most fighting games and indeed its predecessor, two characters square off with the goal of depleting the opponent's life bar. As with the original Killer Instinct, when a player's original life bar is fully depleted, he or she will fall to the ground, and immediately begin on his or her second lifebar.

As with the first game, KI2 relies on an automatic combo subsystem in its matches. The matches, as with Killer Instinct, revolve around a three strength system (Quick, Medium and Fierce). However, normal moves have lost a lot of their priority and range, as well as gaining extra recovery time. Throws have been added into the game to deal with blocking characters (as opposed to the top attack in Killer Instinct). Additionally, characters can be knocked down much easier with normal moves than in the first game, ending the possibility of opening with a 'glitch' combo and also weakening the effectiveness of normal moves. Normal special moves no longer are judged on priority, but instead follow a three tiered 'rock, paper, scissors' system, in which a certain special move will always break another certain special move (similar to the three tiered system in Soul Calibur). The system has been seen as flawed due to little differences between the special moves themselves.

Additionally, a Super bar has been added to the game (similar to Street Fighter Alpha or the The King of Fighters series). This super bar fills as players take damage. After the bar reaches a certain point, the player can use a multi-hit Super Move which is usually an extended version of a normal special move.

The combo system has its roots in the original Killer Instinct. By pressing a certain strength button after an opener move, a player will launch an auto-double and initiate the combo system of the game. However, unlike the first game, players can now open up combos with new and much less risky moves than before (most notable a close Fierce punch or close Fierce kick). Additionally, Super Moves can be placed into combos, greatly increasing their damage and potency as well as being unbreakable. Additionally combos can be extended using throws, super linkers, manual-doubles, and super end specials. As a result of the weakened normal moves and other changes to the system, combos have now become more devastating in KI2. In an apparent effort to help ease this dominance, combo breakers are now easier to perform. Unlike combo breakers in the first game, which also required a three tiered 'rock, paper, scissors' system based on strength to break, combos are now broken depending on the type of attack. Punches break kick doubles, and kicks will break punch doubles.

Parry, an advanced new addition, allow an open counter-attack after a successful parry block. A player can assume a standing defensive position and cause the attacker to temporarily freeze if the parry is successful, and from there either perform a special stunning technique or a 3-hit variant of a Special Move.

The finishing moves have also been reworked. Now each character can only execute these attacks when the opponent's second life bar flashes red (unlike the first Killer Instinct the opponents falls when he or she loses all of his or her energy bars). Each characters has two Ultimate combo moves (one of them can be executed without executing a combo), the Humiliation sequences were dropped, and the Ultra combo feature is still intact.


Characters

Characters returning from the first game:

    Fulgore: A new, enhanced cyborg created after the first Fulgore was destroyed by Jago in the first tournament. His current goal is the destruction of Jago.
    Jago: Succeeded in destroying Fulgore in the first tournament after being possessed by the Tiger Spirit. He was soon betrayed by the Tiger Spirit which turned out to be the demon Gargos in disguise. Gargos used Jago to gain entrance to the physical world. Jago seeks revenge against Gargos's manipulation. It is revealed in this game that Orchid is his sister.
    Spinal: Spinal was destroyed by Chief Thunder in the first tournament. Gargos however had one of his own in the past. Spinal now fights for vengeance and for his freedom.
    T.J. Combo: After he defeated Riptor in the first tournament, T.J. Combo was sent into the past when attempting to destroy the Ultratech building. Now he simply fights to get home.
    Glacius: The original Glacius defeated Cinder and returned home. A distant relative of Glacius 2,000 years in the past heeds a distress call and comes to Earth. His objective is to find his lost brethren and return home.
    Sabrewulf: Captured by Ultratech in the first tournament after being severely injured and beaten. Has been driven mad by experimentation from Ultratech. With cybernetic arms and being 2,000 years in the past, Sabrewulf desperately seeks a cure for his lycanthropy.
    B. Orchid: Orchid destroyed Eyedol in the first tournament which subsequently sent the Ultratech building two millennia into the past. Now Orchid seeks to destroy Gargos and to find a way home. Orchid had a weapon change from the first game. She used laser swords from the first game, but now uses two Tonfas for the second.

[edit] New characters

    Maya - An Amazonian warrior that previously banished Gargos. Maya was banished by her people when Gargos reappeared. Her goal is to destroy Gargos once and for all to regain her former standing. Nintendo Power called Maya the Worst Dressed of 1996; her "Elephant Drop" was also nominated to The "That's Gotta Hurt" Award.
    Tusk - A barbarian that seeks to fight all of the challengers before he believes he will have the right to fight and destroy Gargos.
    Kim Wu - An eastern martial artist that is a descendant of the people who previously drove off Eyedol and Gargos. To protect her people, she seeks to destroy Gargos.
    Gargos - A demon lord that has returned to the physical world. Resembles a huge gargoyle that is very powerful and can also breathe fire. He was the rival of Eyedol, the boss of the first game. Unlike Eyedol in Killer Instinct, Gargos can only be accessed with a cheat code.

Plot

The game describes a "New Frontier Plan" announced by the United States at the end of the 20th century; an ambitious program to enable humans to migrate to Mars. The United States Congress approved an enormous budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Agency to initiate development of this program. Other technologically-advanced countries also participated in the plan. Through an unprecedented cooperative effort, the New Frontier Plan members had built an orbiting space station; life on Mars would soon be a reality.

This plan for developing Mars was officially named the "Mars Frontier Project" (MFP). At the end of the 21st century, a domed structure called the "Plant" was built on Martian soil, and colonization finally began. The first wave of colonists applied themselves to terraforming the planet for human survival; adjusting the atmosphere and securing water resources.

Half a century passed. On Mars, the air was breathable, and oceans formed as the southern ice caps continued to melt. Trees and shrubs gradually flourished; Mars was evolving from a planet of red dust into a lush, green environment. At the beginning of the fifth emigration wave, MFP officials received an alarming report from the Martian colonists; "Unknown lifeforms were appearing near one of the colonies."

Upon receiving the reports, key government officials on Earth were alarmed. To protect the colonists, the United Nations established a military relay station on the Martian moon Phobos and built a military post on Mars itself. This was the opportunity that restless armed forces worldwide had been awaiting. One day troops patrolling an undeveloped part of Mars discovered ancient ruins with what appeared to be signs of alien life. A reconnaissance unit was immediately dispatched; they reported that the ruins were of a civilization destroyed around the 11th century, Earth time. One theory was that the restored atmosphere had awakened the previously dormant Martian creatures, who had been sighted in the area in the past.

Soon after this the trouble began. First, communications from one of the other colonies was suddenly cut off. Then, one after another, each of the other colonies as well as the military post lost all communication channels. An investigative party could leave immediately from Earth but would require several days to reach Mars. The United Nations therefore ordered a test squadron for a new type of experimental assault aircraft, stationed on Phobos, to investigate and eliminate the disturbances on Mars.

Soon after the squadron was airborne, transfer station monitors received the final communication from the military post on Mars: “Mayday! Mayday! What is that?! It’s crawling on the surface… It’s attacking!! Mayday, mayday!”


Characters

Michael Samson
(Second Lieutenant, American)
A young gunner sent to investigate the trouble on Mars. As the gunner, he rides in the automatically piloted experimental aircraft and blasts the enemy. Although he has an impulsive side, he burns with a sense of duty and will bravely stand up against the attacking enemy.

Gregory MacKenzie
(Wing Commander, British)
Samson's commanding officer who gives the player instructions and information from the relay station on the Martian moon, Phobos. A classic career British military man, he is calm and composed, and his subordinates unquestionably trust his judgement. While in active service, MacKenzie won fame for his bravery as the top pilot in the Royal Space Force.

Dr. Linx
(Exo-archeobiologist)
A noted scientist specializing in ancient alien theoretical biology. Linx was sent to the military post on Mars as an archeological researcher. Amazingly, she survived the enemy attack that destroyed her research colony. Because of this experience, Linx has valuable information about the enemy invader.


Gameplay

Knife Edge is for one to four players. The player, while moving between the locations of the game in the Knife Edge ship, controls a cursor that fires vulcan cannon bullets. When more than one player is playing each cursor is color coded to distinguish them. As well as the regular gun, there is the option for a secondary weapon. Hints are provided by a commanding officer over the communication system.

Movement of the vehicle is clearly predetermined, but the player is given some ability to move in the form of the four C-buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller. When a button is depressed the ship will move slightly in the corresponding direction. This is used primarily to avoid obstacles and attacks.

Knockout Kings is a series of boxing games that were produced by EA Sports for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Color and GameCube yearly between 1998 and 2003.

Knockout Kings gives the user a chance to compete against 32 real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. In the game's "slugfest" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight.

There are several differences between Knockout Kings and real-life boxing careers. Championship bouts are only for 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life. In the career mode of Knockout Kings, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. Also, Knockout Kings does not have women's boxing. The exception being the Playstation version of Knockout Kings 2001.[citation needed]

Before releasing Knockout Kings, Electronic Arts released its first 3D boxing game, Foes of Ali, for the 3D0 in 1995. While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.

Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time: Master Quest (?????? ?????? ? Zeruda no Densetsu Toki no Okarina Ura?, ? (Ura meaning reverse side)), featuring reworked dungeons with new puzzles, 

Story

The events of Ocarina of Time take place before those of the first four games and after The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. and are set in the fictional kingdom of Hyrule, the setting of most Zelda games. Hyrule Field serves as a central hub connected to several outlying areas with diverse topography. Most of these areas are populated by the races of Hyrule: Hylians, Kokiri, Gorons, Zoras, and Gerudo.

The game opens as the fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare, in which Link witnesses a stormy night where a man on horseback, Ganondorf, chases Princess Zelda and Impa. Navi brings Link to the guardian of Link's village, the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. Link breaks the curse, but cannot stop the tree from withering. The Deku Tree tells Link a "wicked man of the desert" has cursed him and seeks to conquer the land of Hyrule and that Link must stop him. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree gives Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with the princess of destiny, Zelda.

At Hyrule Castle, Link meets Princess Zelda, who has been having dreams about the future of Hyrule and foresaw Link's arrival. She believes Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of Thieves, is seeking the Triforce, a holy relic in the Sacred Realm that gives its holder god-like power. Zelda's description of Ganondorf matches that of the man who killed the Great Deku Tree. Zelda asks Link to obtain the three Spiritual Stones, one of which he already possesses, so that he might enter the Sacred Realm and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it. Link goes to Goron City, where he meets Darunia, the leader of the Goron race. After Link kills King Dodongo, the boss of Dodongo's Cavern, Darunia gives him the Goron's Ruby, symbolizing brotherhood. Link next obtains the Zora's Sapphire from the Zora Princess, Ruto, after rescuing her from the belly of Lord Jabu-Jabu (a whale-like creature sacred to the Zoras).

Link returns to the castle, where Ganondorf is pursuing Zelda on horseback, as in his nightmare at the start of the game. Spotting Link, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the castle moat and telepathically teaches Link the "Song of Time". Link attempts to stop Ganondorf but is knocked to the ground by a bolt of energy. Ganondorf admires Link's courage, but warns him not to interfere with his plans. After Ganondorf rides off, Link retrieves the Ocarina and uses the song together with the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm. Through the door, Link finds the Master Sword, a legendary sword forged to fight evil. As he pulls the Master Sword from its pedestal, Ganondorf appears, having followed Link into the Sacred Realm, and claims the Triforce.

Seven years later, an older Link awakens in a distant room known as the Chamber of Sages and is met by Rauru, the ancient Sage of Light and one of the seven sages who protect the location of the Triforce. Rauru informs Link that his spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf. The seven sages are capable of imprisoning Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm; however, five of the seven sages are unaware of their identities after Ganondorf transformed Hyrule into a land of darkness. Link returns to Hyrule and is met by the mysterious Sheik, who guides Link to rid five temples of Ganondorf's monsters, allowing the power of the temples to awaken the sages.

After awakening five sages, Sheik is revealed to be Princess Zelda and the Seventh Sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces, as predicted in an ancient prophecy. Ganondorf kept the Triforce of Power, while the other two chosen by destiny carry the remaining pieces: Zelda gained the Triforce of Wisdom and Link obtained the Triforce of Courage. After Zelda bestows Link with Light Arrows, weapons necessary for defeating the dark king, Ganondorf traps Zelda in a magical crystal and takes her to his tower. The remaining six sages help Link enter the tower, where he battles and defeats Ganondorf, thereby freeing Zelda. However, Ganondorf uses his remaining strength to destroy the tower in a final attempt to kill Link and Zelda. The heroes manage to escape the falling castle, but Link is trapped in the resulting rubble by a ring of fire and forced to battle Ganondorf once again; this time, using the power of the Triforce of Power, he transforms from his humanoid Gerudo form into a boar-like monster named Ganon, and immediately knocks the Master Sword from Link's hand outside the ring of fire. After a long battle without the Master Sword, Link, with the aid of Zelda's paralyzing light, retrieves the Master Sword and delivers the final blow. The seven sages trap Ganondorf in the Dark Realm his evil created; still holding the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf vows to take revenge on their descendants. Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link to his original time to live out his childhood, at which point Navi departs. The game ends with Link and Zelda looking at each other in the castle garden.

Gameplay

Ocarina of Time is an action-adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements. The player controls Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional space. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called "Z-targeting" In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects. (In the GameCube port of Ocarina of Time as well as the Wii's virtual console version, targeting is done with the L-button instead of the Z-button, due to the position of the Z-button on the GameCube controller and classic controller.) When using this technique, the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows what will happen when the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it.[16] Much of the game is spent in battle, but some parts require the use of stealth. Exploration is another important aspect of gameplay; the player may notice inaccessible areas and return later to find them explorable after obtaining a new item.


Link gains new abilities by collecting items and weapons found in dungeons or in the overworld. Ocarina of Time has several optional side-quests, or minor objectives that the player can choose to complete or ignore. Completing the side-quests usually results in rewards, normally in the form of weapons or abilities. In one side-quest, Link trades items he cannot use himself among non-player characters. This trading sequence features ten items and ends with Link receiving an item he can use, the two-handed Biggoron Sword, the largest sword in the game. In another side-quest, Link can acquire a horse named Epona. This allows him to travel faster, but attacking while riding is restricted to arrows. In order to get Epona, Link must learn her song while he is a child. However, he is only able to ride her when he and Epona are both adults.

Link is given the Fairy Ocarina near the beginning of the game, which is later replaced by the Ocarina of Time. Throughout the game, Link learns thirteen melodies that allow him to solve various puzzles and teleport to previously visited locations in the game. The Ocarina of Time is also used to claim the Master Sword in the Temple of Time. When Link takes the sword, he is sealed for seven years, until he becomes an adult, and therefore strong enough to wield the Master Sword. Young Link and adult Link have different abilities. For example, only adult Link can use the Fairy Bow and only young Link can fit through certain small passages. After completing the Forest Temple, Link can travel freely between the two time periods by replacing or taking the sword. The melodies and notes are played with the "C" and "A" buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller or the C analogue stick on the Nintendo GameCube controller.

The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is set in Termina, a land parallel to Hyrule, the latter being the main setting of most games in the series. According to legend, Termina was split into five areas by four magical giants that live in four regions of the land. At the center of Termina lies Clock Town, which features a large clock tower that counts down the days before the Carnival of Time—a major festival where the people of Termina pray for good luck and harvests. Termina Field surrounds Clock Town; beyond lie a swamp, mountain range, bay, and canyon in each of the four cardinal directions. The Southern Swamp contains the Deku palace and the Woodfall Temple, an ancient shrine containing monsters. A giant masked jungle warrior, Odolwa, has been poisoning the swamp. The Snowhead mountain range, north of Clock Town, is the site of the Goron village. Normally a lush pine forest region most of the year, the area has been experiencing an unusually long winter caused by a giant masked mechanical monster named Goht in Snowhead Temple. The western area of Termina, the Great Bay, is the site of the Zora and Gerudo civilizations. A gargantuan masked fish, Gyorg, is generating storms and contaminating the water surrounding the Great Bay Temple. The desolate Ikana Canyon, to the east of Clock Town, is the site of a former kingdom. It is inhabited mainly by the undead, except for a ghost researcher and his daughter, as well as a thief. A pair of giant masked insectoid serpents known as Twinmold are casting a dark aura over the land from their nest in Stone Tower Temple.


Plot

Majora's Mask takes place several months after Ocarina of Time and begins with Link searching for an unnamed friend. While in the woods on his horse Epona, the masked Skull Kid and his fairy friends, Tatl and Tael, steal Epona and the powerful musical instrument, the Ocarina of Time, from Link. Link follows them into a dark cave, where he falls down a deep hole. At the bottom, the Skull Kid turns him into a Deku Scrub and runs away with Tael, abandoning Tatl. Upset over the betrayal, Tatl agrees to help Link return to normal.

Link follows the Skull Kid through the cave to Clock Tower in Termina. There he meets the Happy Mask Salesman, who says he can help Link if he retrieves the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask from the Skull Kid. Link and Tatl exit the Clock Tower in the center of Clock Town, which is preparing for the Carnival of Time. Link learns that the moon of the alternate world that this land resides in will crash into Clock Town in three days. He confronts the Skull Kid and Tael at midnight of the third day at the top of Clock Tower, not long before the moon is set to hit. Tael tells Link that he must get four giants, one from the swamp, ocean, mountains, and the canyons. Link is unable to take the mask, but retrieves the Ocarina of Time. He plays the Song of Time on the ocarina, which causes him and Tatl to return to the moment they first arrived in Termina.

The Happy Mask Salesman teaches Link the Song of Healing, which returns Link to his human form and leaves him with the Deku Mask. Link then tells him he did not get the mask and the salesman becomes enraged. He tells Link that Majora's Mask has an evil, apocalyptic power inside that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The ancient ones, fearing catastrophe caused by its great power, "sealed the Mask in shadow forever" to prevent its misuse. This tribe vanished and the origin and nature of the Mask was lost. The Skull Kid, manipulated by Majora's Mask, is responsible for the moon threatening to destroy Termina.

Link travels between Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon. In each region he enters a dungeon and defeats a boss that gives Link the power of one of the Four Giants that can save Termina. With all four bosses defeated, Link summons the Four Giants, who halt the moon's descent toward Termina. Majora's Mask rises from the Skull Kid and possesses the moon. With Tatl at his side, Link follows and defeats Majora's Mask, destroying the moon. The Four Giants return to their sleep and Tatl and Tael reunite with the freed Skull Kid. The Happy Mask Salesman takes Majora's Mask, stating it has been purified of its evil power. Link rides away on Epona while the people of Termina celebrate the Carnival of Time and the dawn of a new day. The game ends with a post-credits scene depicting a drawing on a tree stump of Link, Tatl, Tael, the Skull Kid and the Four Giants while a snippet of "Saria's Song" plays briefly in the background.


Gameplay

The gameplay of Majora's Mask expands on that of Ocarina of Time; it retains the concept of dungeon puzzles and ocarina songs, and introduces character transformations and the restriction of a three-day cycle. As in previous installments, Link can perform basic actions such as walking, running and limited jumping, and must use items to battle enemies and solve puzzles. Link's main weapon is the sword, which can be upgraded throughout the game. Other weapons and items are available—Link can block or reflect attacks with a shield, stun enemies by throwing Deku Nuts, attack from a distance with a bow and arrows, destroy obstacles and damage enemies with bombs, and latch onto objects or enemies with the Hookshot. Magic power allows attacks such as magical arrows or spin attacks, and the use of special items.

Story

The events of Ocarina of Time take place before those of the first four games and after The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. and are set in the fictional kingdom of Hyrule, the setting of most Zelda games. Hyrule Field serves as a central hub connected to several outlying areas with diverse topography. Most of these areas are populated by the races of Hyrule: Hylians, Kokiri, Gorons, Zoras, and Gerudo.

The game opens as the fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare, in which Link witnesses a stormy night where a man on horseback, Ganondorf, chases Princess Zelda and Impa. Navi brings Link to the guardian of Link's village, the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. Link breaks the curse, but cannot stop the tree from withering. The Deku Tree tells Link a "wicked man of the desert" has cursed him and seeks to conquer the land of Hyrule and that Link must stop him. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree gives Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with the princess of destiny, Zelda.

At Hyrule Castle, Link meets Princess Zelda, who has been having dreams about the future of Hyrule and foresaw Link's arrival. She believes Ganondorf, the Gerudo King of Thieves, is seeking the Triforce, a holy relic in the Sacred Realm that gives its holder god-like power. Zelda's description of Ganondorf matches that of the man who killed the Great Deku Tree. Zelda asks Link to obtain the three Spiritual Stones, one of which he already possesses, so that he might enter the Sacred Realm and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it. Link goes to Goron City, where he meets Darunia, the leader of the Goron race. After Link kills King Dodongo, the boss of Dodongo's Cavern, Darunia gives him the Goron's Ruby, symbolizing brotherhood. Link next obtains the Zora's Sapphire from the Zora Princess, Ruto, after rescuing her from the belly of Lord Jabu-Jabu (a whale-like creature sacred to the Zoras).

Link returns to the castle, where Ganondorf is pursuing Zelda on horseback, as in his nightmare at the start of the game. Spotting Link, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the castle moat and telepathically teaches Link the "Song of Time". Link attempts to stop Ganondorf but is knocked to the ground by a bolt of energy. Ganondorf admires Link's courage, but warns him not to interfere with his plans. After Ganondorf rides off, Link retrieves the Ocarina and uses the song together with the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm. Through the door, Link finds the Master Sword, a legendary sword forged to fight evil. As he pulls the Master Sword from its pedestal, Ganondorf appears, having followed Link into the Sacred Realm, and claims the Triforce.

Seven years later, an older Link awakens in a distant room known as the Chamber of Sages and is met by Rauru, the ancient Sage of Light and one of the seven sages who protect the location of the Triforce. Rauru informs Link that his spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf. The seven sages are capable of imprisoning Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm; however, five of the seven sages are unaware of their identities after Ganondorf transformed Hyrule into a land of darkness. Link returns to Hyrule and is met by the mysterious Sheik, who guides Link to rid five temples of Ganondorf's monsters, allowing the power of the temples to awaken the sages.

After awakening five sages, Sheik is revealed to be Princess Zelda and the Seventh Sage. She tells Link that Ganondorf's heart was unbalanced, causing the Triforce to split into three pieces, as predicted in an ancient prophecy. Ganondorf kept the Triforce of Power, while the other two chosen by destiny carry the remaining pieces: Zelda gained the Triforce of Wisdom and Link obtained the Triforce of Courage. After Zelda bestows Link with Light Arrows, weapons necessary for defeating the dark king, Ganondorf traps Zelda in a magical crystal and takes her to his tower. The remaining six sages help Link enter the tower, where he battles and defeats Ganondorf, thereby freeing Zelda. However, Ganondorf uses his remaining strength to destroy the tower in a final attempt to kill Link and Zelda. The heroes manage to escape the falling castle, but Link is trapped in the resulting rubble by a ring of fire and forced to battle Ganondorf once again; this time, using the power of the Triforce of Power, he transforms from his humanoid Gerudo form into a boar-like monster named Ganon, and immediately knocks the Master Sword from Link's hand outside the ring of fire. After a long battle without the Master Sword, Link, with the aid of Zelda's paralyzing light, retrieves the Master Sword and delivers the final blow. The seven sages trap Ganondorf in the Dark Realm his evil created; still holding the Triforce of Power, Ganondorf vows to take revenge on their descendants. Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link to his original time to live out his childhood, at which point Navi departs. The game ends with Link and Zelda looking at each other in the castle garden.

Gameplay

Ocarina of Time is an action-adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements. The player controls Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional space. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called "Z-targeting" In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects. (In the GameCube port of Ocarina of Time as well as the Wii's virtual console version, targeting is done with the L-button instead of the Z-button, due to the position of the Z-button on the GameCube controller and classic controller.) When using this technique, the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows what will happen when the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it.[16] Much of the game is spent in battle, but some parts require the use of stealth. Exploration is another important aspect of gameplay; the player may notice inaccessible areas and return later to find them explorable after obtaining a new item.


Link gains new abilities by collecting items and weapons found in dungeons or in the overworld.

Completing the side-quests usually results in rewards, normally in the form of weapons or abilities. In one side-quest, Link trades items he cannot use himself among non-player characters.

Gameplay

The game mechanics are similar to the original; you outrun 'monsters' by using alternate routes, sliding on ropes, climbing ladders, or drilling holes in the ground to trap them. This game differs from the other incarnations of games from the series because of its apparent three-dimensional perspective. While essentially running in 2-dimensional space, the player has an option to move in another direction every so often. The levels are mostly spirals that require climbing to complete. There are five worlds, and each one must be unlocked by finding five cards from the previous world, excluding the first. Each world is divided into five stages, with each stage divided into four levels. The general goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gold to activate a portal that allows the player to continue. As the player progresses, each world adds new interactive objects and tools, as well as new obstacles. The game is an excellent example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien and Space Panic.

Story

For centuries an impenetrable darkness has shrouded Europe, Arabia, and Asia, with countless victims succumbing to the ravenous hunger of unchecked pestilence and war. In Asia, Khan's ruthless Golden Horde wages a war of terror from the shores of Japan to Europe. In Arabia, the legendary Assassins' Guild asserts a bid for power, toppling sultans and kings. Europe, once a promising glimpse of humanity's potential, has become a well of despair under the despotic rule of a handful of feudal lords.

Many great kingdoms have been devastated, but a few have grown more powerful. These comprise the Covenant of Seven - lords who have allied with Asmodeus, a practitioner of the dark arts who wields the fabled Mace of Tanis. The Mace is imbued with necropotic energy, offering those who wield it a tantalizing promise of ever-lasting life and unbridled power. With this power comes a terrible price: Asmodeus must feed off despair, disease, and poverty. In limited doses, Asmodeus grants the Seven the power they need and crave. In return, they expand their kingdoms with bloody battles and torment their peasants. But Europe can no longer sustain Asmodeus' ravenous appetite. He now reaches East into the Orient, to find new lords who yearn to sample the dark powers.

But there is rebellion. Each of the Seven, addicted to the corrupting power of the Mace, dispatch their best warriors to kill Asmodeus and steal his power. Leaders from the East sense Asmodeus' plottings and strive to destroy him before it's too late. Heirs to kingdoms long since vanquished seek revenge on Asmodeus and those who wield the dark energy. They are the fiercest fighters on Earth, and they all have one thing in common: they each must possess the Mace.


Gameplay

The game is similar to Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. and Mortal Kombat.

Like in Mortal Kombat, when a character wins both rounds, they can perform an execution move on the enemy. Methods included severing an opponents limbs and torso (Al Rashid), beheading (The Executioner), repeated stabbing (Koyasha), impaling the opponent with a sword (Lord Deimos), breaking an opponent's back by hoisting them on top of a Viking helmet and throwing them to the ground, causing their body to explode (Ragnar), and some more far-fetched methods including pulling out an opponent's heart (Xiao Long), shrinking (Namira), transforming the opponent into a chicken (Taria), and entering an opponent's body and bursting them from inside (Dregan).

Madden Football 64 is a football video game. It was the first game of the Madden NFL series to be released for the Nintendo 64. The game has commentary by Pat Summerall and John Madden.


License

This edition does not use real NFL team names or logos. Instead the teams use banners that consist of two bars with the team colors, and the team name on top of them in white, accompanied by players in their uniforms. The Pro Bowl is referred to as the "Madden Bowl", and the Super Bowl as the "EAS Championship".

Teams are referred to by city only, usually the city in which the real life team's stadium is located. The New England Patriots are referred to as "Foxboro", the Tennessee Oilers as "Nashville", the Arizona Cardinals as "Phoenix", the Minnesota Vikings as "Minneapolis", the Tampa Bay Buccaneers simply as "Tampa", the Carolina Panthers as "Charlotte", and certain historic teams for the Los Angeles Rams are referred to as "Anaheim" (despite the Rams not playing in Anaheim until 1980). Team uniforms are altered; all uniforms have white pants, helmet colors are often altered to be different from jerseys (only the Denver Broncos's home jersey and helmet are the same color), and even some already different colors are changed - Foxboro's helmet in this game is red, and Charlotte's is Carolina blue, when in real life both were silver.

The game was the first to feature the concept of covering the ball while running and the chop block and "clothesline" techniques which were later scrapped and moved to players simply tackling ball-carriers. The game also had twelve historic teams including the 1978 Steelers and 1985 Bears and secret teams such as the Tiburon sports team and NFL All-Star teams from each decade.
    This was the first Madden game to feature Franchise Mode, in which the user could control their team for 15 seasons. The user was able to trade players, sign/release players, draft future players, etc.



Glitches and errors

    Offensive Players progressively get better in attributes, while defensive players rise slowly.
    There is an abundance of 90+ rated kickers and punters in the NFL Draft in Franchise Mode and less players rated at any other position and draft talent differs from year to year.
    The NFL Draft in Franchise has only 4 rounds as opposed to 7 in real-life and if the player simulates the draft, they will forfeit their remaining picks.
    If the player waits too long to throw the player will receive a penalty for holding.
    The Nintendo 64 version does not call any penalties except for holding, encroachment, offsides, false start, and delay of game. You may set penalty levels for roughing the passer, roughing the kicker, personal foul, face masking, def pass int., off pass int., fair catch int., punt catch int., clipping, and intentional grounding, but they do not appear to be functional.


Free agents

    Created Players from NCAA Football '99 can be put in the game as free agents and put on other teams in Quick Game Mode.
    Darnell Autry of Northwestern Wildcats football fame is in the game as a free agent.
    Gary Zimmerman appears as a free agent despite being retired at the beginning of the season.

Magical Tetris Challenge Featuring Mickey
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Puzzle
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Capcom
Publisher: Capcom
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Défi au Tetris magique

Gameplay

Magical Tetris Challenge has three gameplay modes: Magical Tetris, Updown Tetris, and Classic Tetris.

Magical Tetris

In Magical Tetris, the player, as either Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, or Goofy, is pitted against an opponent, which is either the A.I. in Story or Endless Modes or another player in Versus Mode. Players control the standard seven Tetris pieces, race to make lines (and consecutive line clears, called combos), and attack the other player. The attacked player receives a set of "magical" pieces, which range from pentomino pieces to square blocks and even very large (up to 5x5-block sized) pieces. Players can also counter one another by making multiple lines to send the pieces back to their opponent. Because of the pentomino pieces, it is possible for a player to clear five lines at once (called a Pentris) using a 5-block straight piece.

Updown and Classic Tetris

Updown Tetris can be considered as an extension of Classic Tetris; Updown Tetris is available in Story and Versus Modes, whereas Classic Tetris takes up what would be the Endless mode. The magical pieces are absent from this mode, and attacking the other player sends a number of lines to the other player; the lines rise from the bottom as filled lines with a one-block gap in a predetermined column and could be used as further lines to attack the opponent.


Common elements

During Magical and Updown Tetris, making lines and combos fills a special meter alongside the board called the Magic Meter, with the fill line initially set to the fourth row; when a player's meter is filled, all of the blocks drop, filling any gaps, and one predetermined column drops out; all the blocks above the meter are wiped clean, the meter resets, and play continues. The meter's fill level may or may not rise depending on the difficulty. In this way, the player is left with filled columns and one empty column, allowing either a Tetris or Pentris to be made easily using a straight piece.

Pieces spawn from the top one row at a time; column grids and a "ghost" piece are provided to aid the players in positioning and dropping pieces. Play stops when a piece entering the grid has to overlap a piece in the board. Players are scored according to the number of combos and counters they make in addition to any other points earned.

Story Mode

Players can choose to be one of four characters (Mickey, Donald, Goofy, or Minnie) to play out the story; each character has a different storyline.

The Game Boy Color version adds three additional modes: Signal Tetris, Towering Tetris, and Target Tetris.

Signal Tetris

In Signal Tetris, clearing a line will cause the floor blocks below the clearing standard seven Tetris pieces will change color. The objective is to get the floor blocks to match the colors of the line of blocks under the floor. As a result, the player has to be careful about the positioning Tetrominos when clearing lines. Easy uses just red and blue for the floor blocks, but the higher difficulties add more colors.


Towering Tetris

Towering Tetris starts you with a pile of random garbage blocks that raises throughout the game. The objective is clear the garbage blocks faster than they can raise until you reach the bottom of the pile and clear the keyhole block on the bottom line. In addition to the standard pieces, this mode also features a special 1*2 Piece that shoots an endless supply of 1*1 blocks when you press A or B and then disappears when it locks into place.


Target Tetris

In this puzzle mode, you are given a preset sequence of Tetrominos with which you must clear all of the Target Blocks(Represented by Acorns, Lightning Bolts, or Flames depending on Mode) on the screen. Each difficulty level has it own set of puzzles, with over a hundred total puzzles.

Review

Ever since the release of the N64, owners of the system have been waiting for a good baseball game. This summer, N64 owners will have their plates full with no fewer than three baseball titles to choose from: Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey, Jr., All Star Baseball '99, and Mike Piazza's Strike Zone. The only question is which one to buy. Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey, Jr. would seem like the front-runner: It's from Nintendo, and it has Ken Griffey Jr.'s endorsement.

Griffey has all of the usual baseball game options: three levels of difficulty, trades, free agents, drafts, and three different modes of play - exhibition, season, and home run derby. Plus, when playing season games you will have to deal with injuries and fatigued players. (You may even have to bench your star player for a game or two if he falls into a slump.)

Graphically Griffey is the same as most 3D polygonal baseball games: Boxy players that move incredibly realistically; the people in the stands look like a watercolor blur; and the real-life stadiums are represented well.

But Griffey tries to makes up for its lackluster graphics with one of the best intelligent cameras in any baseball game to date. The camera tracks high above the ball from the moment it leaves the bat to the moment the outfielder throws the ball in. At the moment the ball leaves the outfielder's hand the camera view changes to a view that's fixed on the plate the ball is heading toward. The changing camera angles really dresses up the otherwise dull visuals.

The biggest and most important factor in the enjoyment of any sports game, however, is control. I dug the control in Griffey. You use the analog stick to control a circular target that resides in the strike zone. The target must be placed over a small box that appears indicating where the pitch is headed. The box may move a bit depending on what type of pitch is thrown. Once the ball reaches the plate and the target is properly placed, you push the A button to swing the bat.

It's almost exactly the same setup as All Star Baseball '99. The only difference between the batting control of Griffey and All Star Baseball '99 is that the target you move within the strike zone returns to the center of the zone in Griffey once you let go of the analog stick. The target in All Star stays where you put it. Simply, this means that the control in Griffey is more interactive and involving because you have to keep in contact with the analog stick at all times - you don't simply set a target and push a button. And because you have constant and complete control, Griffey's control is also more precise than All Star's and is very good.

On Griffey's pitching side, you just pick your pitch and hit the button. As the ball is hurled toward the plate, you can alter the ball's direction slightly by moving the analog stick. A target fades in and out, the idea being that you get a fix on where it is when you can see it, then when it fades out, you quickly move the target to where you want the pitch to end up. The yellow camera buttons represent the bases; for example, when fielding, if you press the left-C button the ball will be thrown to third base, the right-C button first base, and so on.

The control is incredibly precise and intuitive. The main reason Griffey is fun to play is its fast and easy arcade-style control. You don't have to wait for the catcher to throw the ball back to the pitcher after every pitch - you simply pitch, get the call, pitch, get the call. The only negative control issue is that it's hard to get infielders to change direction while running - but that's pretty minor.

Overall, Major League Baseball '99 Featuring Ken Griffey, Jr. is a sound baseball game and a good one. But if simulation-style baseball is your bag, you'd be better off with Acclaim's All Star Baseball '99.

Mario Golf
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Sports > Golf
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Camelot Software Planning
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Players can play as a variety of characters including Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, and Wario. The game also introduces Plum, Sonny, Harry, Maple, and Charlie, new characters created by Camelot specifically for the game. Players can then select from a number of courses which have features adapted to the Nintendo world. Mario Golf is also very easy to play (also known as a "pick up and play" game) as it makes golf very simple, because it does away with many of the complicated real-life aspects of the sport that are found in games like Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006. Although the game is easy to play and simple in appearance, the game's engine is very deep and there are a multitude of variables that can affect a shot, such as wind strength and direction (indicated by a Boo), rain, characters' individual attributes, spin on the ball, and relief of the land. There is a variety of gameplay modes, including speed golf, ring shot, mini golf and skins match. Every character in the game has recorded voice samples which can be used to comment on opponent's shots.


Transfer Pak

This game features Transfer Pak compatibility with the Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf. Players can upload characters and data found on the Game Boy version to the Nintendo 64 version. That way, you can play as these characters in full 3D. Additionally, data from the Nintendo 64 version is saved onto the Game Boy Color version of the game. However, the characters imported onto the Nintendo 64 version are not saved onto the cartridge; you must upload the characters again to play as them on the Nintendo 64. After playing a round with a GBC Character, that character will earn experience points. Transfer Pak functionality is not included in the Virtual Console version

Reception

GameSpot describes the game as easy to play, by having simple features and by "removing the guesswork for gamers who are not familiar with the subtle nuances of golf" that may put off many players

Gameplay

There are four forms of play in the game: Grand Prix, Time Trial, Versus, and Battle. There are eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Princess Peach, Wario, Yoshi, Toad, and Donkey Kong. They vary in weight, speed, and acceleration. There are 16 tracks that are based on different locations seen in Mario video games. Each track has a unique shape, and can contain various obstacles, hazards, and short-cuts. All eight characters participate in each race. Up to four of them can be playable characters, while the rest are computer-controlled for one- or two-player races; three- and four-player races feature no computer-controlled racers. On a track, various actions can be performed to change the flow of a race. Items can be acquired by hitting an item box. The items' uses include acting as projectiles to impede opponents, speeding up the user, or stopping opponents through the placement of bananas and fake item boxes. However, AI-controlled racers use all shells but red shells. One can earn a small turbo boost through obtaining mushrooms, and also by drifting, which one can perform by hopping and tilting the control stick in the direction of the turn, which allows for speedier turns. There is also an advanced drift technique that allows players to turn against the direction of their drift for a speed boost.

In Grand Prix mode, one or two human players compete against computer players in a tournament composed of races on four individual courses, arranged in four-course cups. For each race, points are awarded based on placement, and at the end, the winner is decided based on the number of points accumulated. Difficulty level is measured by engine size: 50, 100, or 150 cc. There is an unlockable difficulty called 'Extra', allowing players to race on mirrored tracks. Time trial mode allows a player to race around any track in the game, either by themselves or against a 'ghost' of a previous run, attempting to improve their time. The player starts with three mushrooms (speed bursts) and cannot obtain any additional items. If the player is racing with a ghost, this phantom player mimics the motions and time of the last personal record run. Versus mode entails two to four players racing head-to-head in a single all-human race on any course. This mode is identical to Grand Prix, but lacks AI players and has the added obstacles of moving bombs that are placed sporadically around the track.

Battle mode pits two to four players against one another in one of four available battle courses. These courses are separate from the race courses, and are suited for more combat-oriented gameplay. Each player begins with three balloons attached to their kart. When damaged, a player will lose one of his or her balloons. When all of the balloons on a kart are gone, the player is eliminated, in the case of a one-on-one match, or turned into a bomb on wheels, able to crash into any living player and cause damage a single time until the match ends. The Block Fort arena is known for its high replay value.

The game is compatible with the N64 Controller Pak, but only to save track ghosts in the Time Trial mode, which requires 121 pages, almost the entire standard controller pak. All other data is stored in-cartridge.


Playable characters

Players can choose from eight characters to operate their kart. Koopa Troopa and Donkey Kong Junior, both of whom appeared in Super Mario Kart, did not return for Mario Kart 64, replaced by Donkey Kong and Wario. In pre-release screenshots, a Magikoopa was playable,[2] but before the game's final release the Magikoopa was replaced by Donkey Kong.

Characters are divided into three categories: lightweights, middleweights, and heavyweight. Mario and Luigi are balanced middleweight characters; Peach, Yoshi, and Toad are lightweights with quick acceleration; Wario, Bowser, and Donkey Kong are heavyweights with responsive steering.

Development

Early years

Production of the game began in 1995 under its original title Super Mario Kart R, but the title was later changed for unknown reasons. The first major public viewing and demo of the game was during the Shoshinkai Software Exhibition on November 24, 1995. In "Mario Kart R", the playable characters were Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Toad, Bowser and a Magikoopa, possibly Kamek.

Prior to the final release of the game, a feather item was playable in Super Mario Kart R as it was in Super Mario Kart


In pop culture

The game is shown being played in a scene by Tony Soprano and his son in The Sopranos episode "Meadowlands".

Gameplay

Consisting of 50 mini games (plus 3 hidden single player mini games), Mario Party takes the form of a traditional board game, with players taking turns to roll the dice block and move ahead the number of spaces shown. There are many different types of spaces players can land on, each producing a different effect. The primary objective of the game is to collect more stars than any other player. The winner of the game is the player with the most stars after all the turns have been completed.

Only one star is present on the board at a given time, appearing randomly on a space on the board where it remains until bought by a player for the specific amount of coins stated (20). After a star is collected, a new one appears on a different space on the game board or stays in the same place depending on the stage chosen. Stars can also be stolen from other players by passing a certain location on the board where a Boo resides—the player must then pay Boo 50 coins for the service of him stealing stars; coin stealing is free.

A secondary objective is to gather coins as well, for they are necessary for buying essential items such as stars and determine the game winner in the event of a tie. Coins are earned by landing on blue spaces or winning mini-games. Coins are lost by landing on red spaces, landing on a Bowser space, or losing certain mini-games.

At the end of each round of play (i.e. after each of the four players have taken their turn) a random mini-game commences. The mini-games are generally short (about a minute in length), and fairly simple. There are 56 of them in total, divided into 4 different categories.

    Four-player mini-games may be divided into three types:
        the cooperative games, in which all four players collectively win or lose
        the competitive free-for-alls, in which players must compete against each other in order to win a limited number of coins
        the non-competitive free-for-alls, in which players accrue coins independently of one another and one player's loss is not automatically another's gain.
    2-on-2 mini-games place players on teams, so they have to cooperate with others in the mini game to win (even though they're still competing against each other in the main game)
    1-on-3 mini-games have a team of three against a lone player. Often, the game's objective is for either the lone player or the team of three to survive for a certain amount of time while the opposing player/team tries to take them out. The team of three must cooperate in order to win.
    One-player mini-games only occur during a round when a player lands on a One-player mini-game space. They give a single player an opportunity to earn (or lose) coins depending on his or her performance in the mini-game.

At the end of the game there are three bonus stars given out. The coin star award is given to the player who collected the most coins at any one point during the game, the mini-game star award is awarded to the player who collected the most coins in mini-games, and the player who landed on the most "?" spaces earns the Happening Star. It is common for more than one character to be awarded the same bonus star; this happens if there is a tie for the category in question. The person with the most stars after the bonus awarding has concluded is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the player with the most coins wins, and if two players have the same number of both stars and coins, a dice block will be rolled to determine the winner.

Mini-games happen at the end of each round or occasionally during a round when a player lands on a Bowser space or One-player mini-game spaces. In most situations, the winner(s) of a mini-game receive ten coins for their victory. In some mini-games, the losing player(s) have to pay the winner(s) a sum of coins.



Modes

Adventure Mode

The standard mode of play, as described in Gameplay above. Up to four players play a board game interspersed with mini games, trying to collect as many stars as possible by the end of a set number of turns. The coins and stars earned in Adventure Mode are tallied up and transferred to a fund which the player can use to unlock things in the game.

The type of mini-game (4-player, 1-vs.-3, and 2-vs.-2) is determined by what color the players' panels are. If all four players have the same color panels, a 4-player game is selected. If there's 1 blue panel, and 3 red panels or vice versa, a 1-vs.-3 game is selected. If there are 2 panels of both colors, a 2-vs.-2 game is selected. If there's a green panel, the color will switch to either red or blue randomly.

 Mini-Game Island

A one-player mode in which the player navigates a world map and must win mini games in order to progress across the map. Winning mini games gives the player coins, and collecting 100 coins grants the player a life. Losing a mini game causes the player to lose a life. If the player loses all of his or her lives, the game ends, and the player must resume from where he or she last saved. After beating 49 mini games and reaching the goal, a waiting Toad can be found. The player will then be challenged to a game of slot car derby. Once the player wins, Bumper Ball Maze 1 and Bumper Ball Maze 2 (If the player completed all 49 mini games preceding the goal) are unlocked; upon winning 1 and 2 in the mini-game shop, Bumper Ball Maze 3 is unlocked. The Bumper Ball Maze mini games are only playable in the mini game shop.

Mini-games

There are 65 mini-games in Mario Party 2. They are divided into four-player, one vs. three, two vs. two, and battle games. The type of mini game is selected by what space the players land on. If all 4 players have the same color panel, whether it's red or blue, a four player mini game begins. If 2 players have a blue panel, and the other 2 have a red panel, then it's a two versus two mini game. If one player has a blue panel, and the others have a red panel, or vice versa, then a one versus 3 mini game begins. If a player lands on a battle space, a battle mini game begins. The mini games have varied objectives. For example the objective of "Mecha Marathon" is to get your nudge wind up toy the furthest by repeatedly tapping A+B at the same time. Some mini games(such as "Face Lift" using the main characters instead of Bowser) have been edited and transferred and/or also retitled from the first Mario Party to this Mario Party, however some mini-games have different things in order to win the game and/or change appearance in some way. An example is slot car derby, which has a new background. Although, mini-games that involve rotating the control stick that were in the original Mario Party were not transferred because of injuries, such as blisters, from rotating the control stick too quickly.


Items

A character comes across several opportunities to either buy, win, or steal items. Such items include mushrooms, skeleton keys, treasure chests, and others. The red mushroom allows a player to hit the dice block twice and move the sum of the numbers in spaces. If a player rolls the same number twice, he or she gets a bonus of 10 coins. Accordingly, rolling 3 of the same number with the golden mushroom results in a 20 coin increase.


New features

All of the playable characters from the original game are still available, but this time, they are all dressed in costumes unique to the board players are playing on (except for Bowser Land, on which they wear their usual attire). Board characters include Toad, Baby Bowser, and Boo, with the notable absence of Bowser and Koopa Troopa (although both have roles in the game). Another new feature of the game is the introduction of buildings on the boards: the Item Shop and the Koopa Bank, as well as power ups such as the "Red" and "Gold" mushrooms which allows players to roll up to 2 or 3 dices at once. All the board titles end with "land", (ex. "Bowser Land", "Space Land", etc.) and unlike in the original, the winner is announced during a cutscene in which the winner thwarts Bowser who harasses Koopa during certain scenarios appropriate to the board's theme. Baby Bowser also appears and accompanies the space where the location of the previous star was and takes 5 coins from the player who passes by, although every once in awhile, he'll sometimes reward the player 5 coins instead. Boo can still take coins and stars from other players like he did in the first game but unlike in the first game where stealing coins was free, it now costs 5 coins but unlike in the first game he can steal twice as many coins where in the original he could only steal anywhere from 1-20 coins, stealing stars still costs 50 coins like it did in the first game. In the first game, all eight game boards featured Koopa giving the players 10 coins every time they overlapped the board (20 coins within the last five turns) however this feature was omitted in this game, with the exception where it still occurs on the Mini-Game Stadium board.

Mario Party 2 also features several new spaces, with the "1-Player Mini Game" and "Mushroom" spaces from the first game absent; the Battle, Item, and Bank spaces are introduced. The Item space activates mini-games specific to the board that allows someone a chance to collect an item, which is now used to further players' board strategy (as opposed to items being used to toggle universal settings in the first game where certain items appeared randomly during the board gameplay mode). The Battle space triggers the newly introduced Battle mini-games, which puts players against each other for a giant pot of coins with a 70/30 percent ratio share for the 1st and 2nd place winners. The Bank space gives players who land on it all deposits made in the Koopa Bank by others, who must deposit a minimum of 5 coins (1-4 coins if they have less than 5 coins) if they pass the space. One exception however occurs on Bowser's board, where the rules are reversed: players passing the bank get 5 coins while the player landing on the "Bank" space must pay back the total balance.

The game also features six brand new boards and modes (including Mini-Game Coaster, akin to the original Mario Party's Mini-Game Island where the player must beat several mini-games across 3, 6, or even 9 worlds depending on which difficulty is chosen) The return of Mini-Game Stadium. Forty-three new mini-games were introduced in Mario Party 2, while old Mario Party mini-games were updated and some were retitled. Three new types of mini-games are also introduced: Battle mini-games, Item mini-games, and Duel mini-games. Also unlike in the first game, players no longer lose coins if they lose in a mini-game. Once all of the chosen amount of rounds on the selected board are used up (Which always consists of 20, 35, or 50 turns like in the original) the total number of coins and stars both the human and computer players collected during the board and mini-games are rewarded and added to the coin bank. Unlike in the original where only the human player(s)' coins and stars were added. Also unlike in the original, each star collected both by the human and computer players is worth an additional 50 coins, where in the original the player had to collect 100 stars to unlock the final board "Eternal Star".

Mario Party 3
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Party
Release Year: 2001
Developer: Hudson Soft
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: Single-player, multiplayer

Gameplay

For the first time ever, players can now play a duel board with up to two people, and there are 8 characters in the game. This is also the first game to feature twelve game boards. The objective in Mario Party 3, as in the other games, is to move the player's character around the board and collect coins and stars. The player with the most stars (and most coins if stars are tied [if both stars and coins are tied, a dice block decides the game]) at the end of the game wins. Coins are found on many spaces on the board and also earned in mini-games. Stars are found on the board for purchase and can also be acquired through certain items or special events.

Players take turns moving around the board by hitting a dice block, the game's equivalent of rolling a die. The character moves the given number of spaces and may trigger special actions or events by passing or landing on certain spaces. After all four characters have moved, a mini-game begins. Mini-games can also be triggered by certain special event spaces.

This game introduces Story Mode to the series, in which one player starts a campaign through every board, challenging computer controlled opponents at a shortened version of party mode. The player's objective is to defeat the other characters and earn stamps from the Millennium Star. After all 7 stamps are acquired the player is challenged to a final duel with the Millennium Star. This mini-game is called the Star Dust Battle in which the player must hit the Millennium Star 3 times with stars in order to defeat story mode. When this has been accomplished, a title representing the player's overall progress in the game is awarded. If at least 8 "S" ranks are acquired, that character becomes a 'Miracle Star" and the Game Guy Room in the Mini Game House is opened for use. Simply beating the Story Mode and not earning a high title will cause the character's face to be sculpted into the mountain.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which four players play through a board. Princess Daisy was the only Nintendo main character to not have a board named after her (i.e. "Peach's Birthday Cake"). Mario Party 3 and Mario Tennis 64 were the only times Daisy still had her "Classic" look.

Battle mini-games are featured here as in Mario Party 2. These games are like the 4-player games, but generally more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (10, 20, 30, 50, or sometimes 0, in which the battle is cancelled) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding.

Duel games pit two players against each other. These are engaged through a Dueling Glove and in the last 5 turns in the game where if a player lands on the same space as another a duel is initiated. In Party Mode, one player initiates the duel, and bet coins against another player. The winner of the duel wins all of the coins in the bet. There is an option to turn off duels that contain only computer players.

Every game in the Mario Party series contains 50 to 80 mini-games of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 mini-games put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the mini-game to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

New to this edition are Game Guy mini-games. When a character landed on a Game Guy space, he/she is forced to surrender all of his/her coins and play a chance-based mini-game. If the game is won, the coins of the character are multiplied, usually twofold, but in one of the games, it is possible to win up to 64-fold. However, if the game is lost, then the character will not receive his/her coins back. These games proved to be unpopular and were not continued in subsequent Mario Parties.

Playable characters

Mario Party 3 still includes Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, Yoshi, and Donkey Kong, with the addition of Waluigi and Princess Daisy.

Gameplay

The game uses a control system that differs from most other video tennis games on the market. Shots are performed by pressing one, or both, of the two main buttons (A or B), which make the ball spin in different ways. Pressing a button twice strikes the tennis shot with more power and spin. Additionally, pressing the two buttons in a different order can result in a different type of shot altogether, such as a lob or drop shot. all 4 buttons can be pressed at the same time to hit a very powerful smash shot. The longer a button is pressed before contact is made with the ball, the stronger the shot will be. The control system allows players of all levels to become familiar with the mechanics of the game within a very short time, whilst also encouraging advanced players to take advantage of the variety of shots on offer to come up with different strategies for winning points. A total of seven types of shot are possible using only the one main button of the controller.

These gameplay mechanics were later brought to the other games of the Mario Tennis series in Mario Tennis GBC, Mario Tennis: Power Tour and Mario Power Tennis.


Characters and Transfer Pak features


Marking the sixth Mario game for the Nintendo 64, Mario Tennis brings eleven new characters to the Mario Tennis franchise, including Waluigi, Princess Daisy (Prior to Mario Tennis, Daisy's last appearance was as Luigi's caddy in the 1991 arcade game Open Tournament Golf), Wario, Shy Guy, Donkey Kong and Birdo.

Through the use of an N64 Transfer Pak, players are able to import his or her characters from the Game Boy Color version of Mario Tennis to the N64 game, as well as the characters' stats. After connecting Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color with Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64, various options become available; Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi and Bowser can all be sent to the Game Boy Color Version, and GBC characters Alex, Harry, Nina and Kate can be transferred to the Nintendo 64 version. Using the latter four characters, experience points may be earned to transfer back to the GBC version. As the characters go up in levels, one may send his or her improved characters to the N64 version to level up again.

A variety of tennis courts can become available to unlock in the Nintendo 64 version after linking with the Game Boy Color Version.

On the Virtual Console version, the absence of Ring Tournament in Special Games and the ability to unlock extra characters and courts through the Transfer Pak has been removed.

Description

Mega Man blasts his way onto the Nintendo® 64 System for the first time ever! This epic adventure combines the best of classic Mega Man action with enormous bosses, a riveting storyline and all the depth of the hottest RPG. Explore vast 3-D worlds in your quest to find the treasure of all treasures, the Mother Lode. You'll love the stunning 3-D graphics, powerful weapons and non-stop action ...unless of course, you're a boos.

Plot

Setting and characters

The Legends series take place on a flooded Earth. Because of the flooding, only a few sparse islands exist and energy sources are rare. In order to satisfy this increasing demand for energy to power up machinery, quantum refractors found in ancient ruins are used. These refractors are valuable, they serve as an energy source, and their shards are used as currency. However, the main goal of every person is to find the Mother Lode, an item of supposed infinite power that can fill the need for the energy in one swoop. Those who try to excavate these ruins are called "Diggers" ("Digouters" in the Japanese version). The protagonist of the game is Mega Man Volnutt, a Digger living in a ship called Flutter. He lives there alongside Roll Caskett, his Spotter who is searching for her missing father, Barrel Caskett, Roll's grandfather, and Data, a mysterious monkey that talks in gibberish only Mega Man himself can understand. The game's antagonists are pirates known as the Bonnes who want to steal Kattelox's secret treasure in order to become rich. They consist of Teisel Bonne, the leader of the group.[11] His sibling are Tron Bonne, who builds most of their robots used in their elaborate schemes (and develops feelings for Mega Man), and the youngest brother, Bon Bonne, who can only say one word—"Babu!" The Bonnes are accompanied by forty Servbots, robots under the care of Tron.

Story

The game begins with MegaMan Volnutt trying to exit a ruin after finding the refractor inside. After dealing with the Reaverbots blocking his way out, he makes his way to the Flutter, which leaves the ruin. However, the Flutter experiences some engine problems and crash lands on Kattelox Island. From there, the Caskett try to find a way to repair their ship. However, when the pirates the Bonnes attack Kattelox's city with giant mechanicals, Mega Man decides to stop them. Once Mega Man is able to defeat each member individually, Kattelox's mayor, Amelia, tells Mega Man the Bonnes are searching for the island's secret treasure and that it is said if somebody obtains it, a disaster will happen in the island. Amelia asks Mega Man to explore the island's ruins in order to investigate it. With a refractor found in a ruin, Roll and Mega Man are able to repair the Flutter, allowing them to find a cave to continue exploring the island. While exploring the cave, Mega Man activates the Main Gate, a dungeon where he should be able to find the reason why Reaverbots from the island are being activated. Before being able to enter into the Main Gate, Mega Man once again confronts the Bonnes who after being defeated once again, decide to let Mega Man enter the Main Gate and then take their chance to steal the treasure.

When Mega Man enters the Main Gate, he discovers it is actually a stasis chamber for the robot Mega Man Juno, a 3rd class bureaucratic unit from Eden, a space station orbiting above the planet. When he is accidentally awakened from his sleep by Mega Man, Juno makes many strange revelations, among them referring to Mega Man as "Mega Man Trigger", and realizing that Mega Man is suffering from memory loss. Juno claims that the island's population needs to be purged so it will be more controllable confronts Mega Man when he tries to stop him. After a struggle, Juno is defeated and dies. Even with Juno's physical body gone, he transfers his backup data into the systems of Eden, and the Carbon Purification Process was still continuing its preparations. Data gives new commands to the system, stopping the Purification and also deleting Juno's backup data from Eden. Data then reveals to Mega Man that he contains all of his previous memories, when he was Mega Man Trigger. Mega Man had stored his memories into Data as a way to prevent Eden from ever tampering with it. Data promises that he will restore Mega Man's memory when the time comes. The residents proclaim Mega Man a hero and the Caskett family rides the repaired Flutter to continue their journey.




Gameplay

Mega Man Legends differs greatly from the platforming gameplay of past Mega Man games, the main factor being the three-dimensional worlds, and three-dimensional movement therein. Unlike the original Mega Man series which are platform games, Legends is an action roleplaying game. The player controls Mega Man Volnutt across the title, in which he has to complete different missions such as investigating ruins or fighting pirates. The player travels through a large world, with various dungeons that are explored in a certain order, as well as a town with non-player characters to talk to. As such, the plot is revealed through cutscenes.
An early boss battle in which Mega Man battles robots controlled by pirates.

Although the only way to move on the game is by walking, once Roll Caskett repairs support car, she is able to directly take Mega Man to specific areas. In Legends, large gems called Refractors are used as a power source. Small shards of them can be exchanged for money, and in the game, enemies that are destroyed will often drop these Refractor Shards. When shards are picked up, the equivalent amount of Zenny, the game's basic unit of currency, is added automatically. The health of Mega Man can be increased through the game in the shops, while it can be recovered through packs bought at shops, obtaining red spheres from defeated opponents or by asking the character Data to recover Mega Man's health. Mega Man also has a Life Shield which reduces the damage that he can receive from enemies. The damage caused by enemies can also be reduced by obtaining upgrades to Mega Man's armor or his helmet. Mega Man's interactions with characters from the game can also affect the price of objects. If the player makes Mega Man be rude with characters, prices from objects will be increased and the dialogues with people will also change.

The power of Mega Man's main weapon - the Buster Gun - depends on Buster Parts equipped. Buster Parts can be equipped to upgrade four stats of the Buster Gun; Attack (how strong it is), Rapid (how fast it fires), Range (how far the shots go), and Energy (how many shots can be fired before stopping). Buster Parts can be retrieved from stores or from dungeons. Additionally, Roll is able to create Buster Parts from unusable objects found in the ruins. Roll is also able to make weapons for the player, using specific combinations of parts that can be found in dungeons or bought in shops. Many of these weapons supplement the Buster Gun. The only way to refill them in the field is an item that can be bought, but only one can be carried. Only one special weapon can be equipped at a time, and the only way to switch is to talk to Roll, unlike the original series. Special weapons can be upgraded, and have five stats; Attack, Rapid, Range, Energy, and Special. In order to upgrade them, the player must pay a specific amount of Zenny.



Characters

    * MegaMan Volnutt (???·??????, Rock Volnutt in the original version?) is the main character of the series. He is found sealed within a crystal along with Data during an excavation of Nino Island by Barrell Caskett, who brings him in and raises him. He is named after Roll's favorite video game character and soon grows up to be a Digger, searching for adventure, providing for his makeshift family, and protecting them all from the Bonnes and other dangers. It is eventually revealed that he was once as a First Class Purifier Unit named Mega Man Trigger charged with the protection of Elysium. After being told to destroy the Master System by the Master, he battled and defeated Sera. However his damage was so extensive that he was forced to have his memory removed and placed within Data and was reset to the default configuration of a newborn baby. He was then sealed within the crystal by Yuna. Volnutt also appears as a playable character in Namco X Capcom and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars.
    * Roll Casket is Mega Man's friend and Digging partner. She often aids MegaMan as a Spotter during his dungeon adventures by keeping in radio contact and warning him of dangers and hidden caches. She also makes weapons for him and transports him around the city using the Caskets' van that she fixed. Her parents (Barrell's daughter and her husband) were diggers who mysteriously disappeared on a dig of Forbidden Island. She appears in Namco X Capcom as MegaMan's partner character.
    * Professor Barrell Caskett is Roll's grandfather, and MegaMan's adoptive grandfather. Barrell is a famous Digger and the author of various books on the subject. He discovers MegaMan while on Nino Island without permission, and takes in Roll after her parents disappear.
    * Data is a small robot monkey found with MegaMan. He accompanies Roll as a pet, and he can communicate with MegaMan, though others eventually learn to understand him. He holds all of MegaMan's memories, and MegaMan is the only person able to retrieve them.
    * The Bonne Family are the leaders of the Servbots, who often create difficulties for Mega Man and Roll as they continue on their adventures. Tron Bonne is the genius of the trio, and the creator of the Servbots and various fighting machines. She harbors a crush on MegaMan. Bon Bonne is essentially a baby, encased in a large, mechanical fighting suit and he is only able to say "Babu." Teisel Bonne is the tactician of the group, though most of his plans are very extravagant. Tron Bonne is a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and Namco X Capcom with Servbots as a partner character; she has also starred in her own spinoff game, The Misadventures of Tron Bonne.
    * Servbots (???, Kobun?) are a group of forty-one small, indestructible robots created by Tron Bonne to do her bidding. Each Servbot has an ability from cooking to cleaning to battle, and they do various chores on board the Bonne family airship, the Gesellschaft. They behave like children and love and adore Tron like a mother, however strict she may be with them. Somehow, they look like a trademark of Lego characters. Despite their small size, they can be quite powerful fighters and are vital to the Bonnes' success as pirates. Servbots accompany Tron in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes and Namco x Capcom during several of her special moves, and one is also a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes. They also cameo in Dead Rising as a toy helmet that can be worn or placed on zombies (which is also implemented as one of Frank West's hyper combos in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars), the Mega Man Battle Network series as merchandise found throughout the games, and Onimusha 3: Demon Siege as a weapon. They are voiced by Chisa Yokoyama.
    * Mistress Sera and Mistress Yuna are "Mother Units" specifically designed to watch over Elysium and Terra. Sera, jealous of the attention MegaMan receives from the Master, the final living human and overseer of Elysium, does battle with MegaMan after he is ordered by the Master to destroy the System Library. She is defeated and sealed on Forbidden Island by Yuna, and Yuna also takes care of MegaMan. Yuna inhabits the body of Matilda, Roll's mother, because she used her own body to repair Matilda's dying body. They are served by Gatz and Geetz, who have the ability to change from humanoid forms to large bird forms.
    * MegaMan Juno is the master of all the ruins on Kattelox Island. He is awakened by Volnutt, and he attempts to reinitialize the island's systems, which have the potential to kill the island's inhabitants.
    * Lex Loath is a loan shark, who wishes to awaken the Sleeping Colossus, a giant Reaverbot. His main henchman is Glyde, the leader of the "Birdbots", small bird-like robots.
    * Bola and Klaymoor are two veteran pirates, who search for the keys to the Mother Lode, though only Klaymoor really cares. Bola wields a claw and a sword, while Klaymoor has a machine gun as a replacement for his arm.

Game Play

The official players in Mike Piazza's Strike Zone have different batting and pitching styles as well as stamina that causes them to perform with less precision after being used continuously. When batting the ball has a flame-like trail behind it that tells the hitter whether it is in the Strike Zone (red) or in the Ball Zone (blue), allowing the player to better choose which balls to hit. Saving the season, and saving a player created team, require separate Control Paks. While playing with a Rumble Pak it cannot be replaced with the control Pak while the game is being played, and a separate controller is needed to save


Reception

With a long list of customizable features and early test previews, the game received good previews from gaming Sites such as IGN.  When finally released, however, the game was criticized for its graphics, few voice clips, continuous sound elements repeating themselves over and over, simple challenges and unrealistic home run hitting. It was compared to contemporary games such as All-Star Baseball '99 and Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey, Jr., both released for N64 that same year. .The game would generally receive low scores from the gaming media;

Story

While visiting the planet Clancer, Professor Theo, a self-proclaimed 'genius in robotics', is kidnapped by the Empire, acting upon orders from their evil emperor and estranged twin brother of Theo, who wishes to fill the world with hate and despair. Upon realizing Theo's abduction, his robotic maid Marina Liteyears sets out to rescue him. Every person, animal and inanimate object on the planet (including the planet itself) has an identical "face", seemingly belonging to a species called 'Clancer'.

The game sets through five stages on Planet Clancer, each one containing approximately 10 levels. The first stage that Marina will have to confront is full of theme parks, whacked desserts and local gangsters. Here we meet King Aster (the leader of resistance against the Empire), Teran (a young boy attempting to get into the resistance) and other secondary characters, such as Calina, Marina's enemy and copycat.

Marina then manages to enter a world of volcanos and hot magma, where Migen kidnapped Professor Theo following the orders of his superiors. After defeating Migen Sr. and his son, Marina Liteyears gets to a cold world near a frozen mountain, where the local town is waiting for the Olympic Clancer Games. Marina gets into a fight with Lunar -the first boss of the Beastector, a powerful evil trio- a robotical human-wolf with a machine gun in his arm, but eventually loses against Marina's strength.

Marina participates in the Olympic Games and wins the prize, Professor Theo. Suddenly a Clancer Kitten attempts to "fight" Marina but as he's too weak, he loses and as was stipulated, the Clancer Kitten takes Marina to the first boss shrine in the game: Cerverus Alpha, which is basically Lunar on a mechanical wolf. The Clancer Kitten helps Marina in this fight, and is later dismissed by her after defeating Cerverus and his wolf.

Again at home, Theo gets to be kidnapped again by Calina. So Marina has to save him again.

Meanwhile, the Empire is secretly watching Marina's steps, as she enters another world with huge mountains and rock slides. There, she will meet Taurus (later, Sasquatch Beta), a mechanical monkey-man with huge strength. Later in the game is beaten by Marina.

Marina saves Professor Theo and takes him home, just to be kidnapped by other Clancer minions.

The last level takes place inside the Empire. Marina must now defeat Merco, a handsome eagle-man with sword techniques. Merco later transforms to Phoenix Gamma and fights Marina in a flying level.

After the Beastector is beaten, Marina must destroy the Emperor Leo and later the final boss of the game, a giant robot which turns out to be a combination of the former Beastector.

The game ends showing the Clancers celebrating the end of the Empire. Teran attempts to escape, claiming that he's not a kid, but a hero that came from the sky. Two paths are opened here: one that shows Teran escaping after punching Marina, and another where Marina grabs Teran by his arm and tries to calm him down. In either one, Teran ends shedding a tear next to his younger sister, who tells him that he always be part of the Clancer family.

The credits (or bonus), shows the human form of the Beastector (as long as all the Gold Gems were picked); and finally, the human form of Marina Liteyears.

Gameplay

Marina's main way of attacking is her grab move. She is able to take hold of enemies, objects, weapons and even some enemy projectiles or attacks, which can be thrown or shaken, depending on the object. When certain objects are shaken, items such as crystals might appear. When Marina shakes some other objects, a secondary effect may be activated.

Later on in the game, Teran is available to play in two levels. His moves includes a standard punch, upper punch, low kick and a block move. He also has the ability to hang from ceilings. His signature skill is the ability to jump up to three times consecutively.

Hidden within every stage is a gold gem. These gems are used in the final cutscene of the game with every gem adding one to three seconds to the ending. The extended ending adds character development to the villains, among various other things. The way the gold gem appears differs from stage to stage. For example, the gold gem will only appear on some boss stages if the boss is defeated without Marina being hit.

Gameplay

The player controls Ethan Hunt in most of the missions, and the majority of the game centers around completing tasks undetected or disguised. The player can choose from a wide variety of weapons and gadgets, including pistols and automatic weapons. On select missions they are given the explosive gum and the Facemaker from the movie. They are also given explosives to set on targets. Other equipment Ethan is provided with includes smoke generators, infra-red contacts, gas injectors, fingerprint scanners, and computer disks.

Unlike most other shooters of the time, the gameplay often required the player to exercise caution and restraint in carrying out mission objectives. In many missions, outright use of violence is discouraged or even penalized, and it is easy to fail a mission by accidentally shooting the wrong person. Most of the missions require the player to stealthily infiltrate or sneak out of areas, such as CIA Headquarters in Langley. They can infiltrate some facilities only using the Facemaker, which disguises themselves as one of the enemy. Sometimes the player is required to do this multiple times.

The levels roughly follow the storyline of the movie, though there is a subplot based in Russia that is entirely original. There are five missions comprising 20 levels


Plot

The game starts with Jim Phelps in a park outside the CIA, getting a message about a terrorist plot in northwestern Russia planning to send missiles to a rival country. Phelps sends IMF agents Ethan Hunt, John Clutter and Andrew Dowey to stop the terrorists' plans by infiltrating the submarine pen where the missiles are being stored, then destroying the submarine holding the missiles.

While this is happening, Alexander Golystine, a worker at the Embassy of Russia in Prague, kidnaps the female IMF agent Candice Parker and steals one half of the Non-Official Cover (NOC) list, a list that gives the real and false names of all IMF agents. Though useless on its own, the Embassy possess a powerful supercomputer that may be capable of breaking the code to open the document, and after IMF agent Robert Barnes goes missing after an attempted rescue mission, Phelps sends in Hunt to find the list, rescue Candice Parker, and discover the fate of Robert Barnes.

Hunt successfully begins the mission by entering the Embassy unarmed, using inside contacts Sarah Davies and Dieter Harmon to procure equipment. He then knocks out the Ambassador's aide, assuming his identity using a Facemaker, and makes his way through an underground warehouse to find the KGB headquarters. Still in disguise, he is able to discover the fate of Barnes, who has been tortured to death, and rescues a sickened and injured Parker. In spite of her handicap, however, they are able to recover the NOC list and escape using the cover of a fake fire (set off by Hunt using smoke generators in the ventilation).

Despite his work in recovering the NOC list as well as agent Parker, Hunt is taken to interrogation at the CIA, where he is accused of being a mole for a person known as Max. He manages to escape his captors and, after secretly making his way through the building, is able to reach the rooftop. After doing so, he is able to infiltrate the security atop the building, prevent backup from arriving by helicopter, and freeze another helicopter to ensure he has a way out. He then reaches the top of the building, where he uses fiber optic cable to descend into the famous laser-filled terminal room from the movie. Here, he steals the NOC list, leaves a computer virus in the terminal to shut off the lasers, and escapes in the helicopter to his next mission as a rogue agent.

Hunt reaches Waterloo Station in London, having secured the support of two ex-agents, (Luther Stickell and Franz Krueger) and meets with the secretive Max. Max, however, steals the NOC list and leaves her henchmen to execute Hunt, though Stickell and Krueger successfully protect him with sniper fire as he awaits further details from Parker. When they finally discover where Max has escaped to, Hunt infiltrates her train (which is well-protected by more of her henchmen) and successfully kills her, taking back the NOC list. As he makes his way to the cargo area where Max has set up a bomb, he discovers that his former mentor, Jim Phelps, is the real mole. Hunt chases Phelps onto the roof of the train and manages to kill him, destroying his helicopter as he tries to escape. Afterwards, Hunt returns to the CIA, where he is cleared of all suspicion.

Shortly afterwards, Hunt, now IMF team leader, (having replaced the traitorous Phelps) recruits John Clutter and Andrew Dowey for one final mission. The terrorist group from the first mission has returned, and the old team must go back to stop their plans once and for all by destroying their base entirely. The three manage to infiltrate the base by destroying key security features, and eventually manage to stop the terrorist group by killing their leader, Basil Prokosh. They escape by stealing a gunboat from the base, and manage to take out more key buildings, ensuring that they can't be used again. They finally escape their pursuers and meet Parker on top of a submarine, where she waits to take them back to IMF headquarters.

Monaco Grand Prix known in Europe as Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2 is a Formula one racing game for the Nintendo 64, Sony Playstation, and Sega Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars etc. (The licence was held by Video System at the time who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II.) The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others[citation needed]. This helps to add to the authenticity of the game.

The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.

Overview

It offers improved graphics, an updated interface, new trucks and tracks and the addition of variable weather conditions from its predecessor. However, the game engine is essentially the same as that utilized in the original game. A testament to their similarity is the fact that most custom trucks and tracks are compatible with both games.

The "Summit Rumble" king of the hill tracks could only be played if one intended to compete online.

Again, "Army" Armstrong provides commentary for the game. However, his race calls have been updated, and new ones have been added.

Just like its predecessor, it contains an inaccessible truck, "Chuck's Car" (a Chevrolet Camaro). It was intended to be unlocked by typing in "CHUCK" in a race. The game still displays this message when typed: "Restart the game to drive Chuck's Car." However, if one restarts the game, it isn't there.

The game contains assets from older TRI games, like Hellbender and CART Precision Racing.

When the Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback wheel was launched, the installation cd also contained the game.

Monster Truck Madness 64 is a Nintendo 64 port of Monster Truck Madness 2. It was released in 1999.

Plot

Thousands of years before the start of the series, Shinnok, one of the Elder Gods who control the six realms in the Mortal Kombat universe, attempted to become the conqueror from all of them. Thunder God Raiden fought and defeated Shinnok in a war that spanned hundreds of years, sending him afterwards to the Netherealm, where he would be trapped forever. Now, Shinnok managed to escape from the Netherealm with help from the sorcerer Quan Chi, and seeks revenge to the Elder Gods who banished him. In his plan, he first conquers the realm of Edenia, with the aid of a traitor, Tanya, while he prepares to attack the Elder Gods. In order to stop Shinnok's menace, Raiden requests the help from the Earthrealm warriors who managed to save the realms from Emperor Shao Kahn in previous titles.


Gameplay

Mortal Kombat 4 is played in a similar way to the previous titles from the series. It however introduces a limited weapon system, allowing one to take out a weapon using a set button combination, having an almost completely new movelist for the said character. The weapons can also be thrown and dropped, in similar fashion as the arena objects; if an opponent's weapon is dropped the other character is able to hold it and use it. By sidestepping the player is able to move the camera, making both characters unable to hold up the weapons or objects they had in the ground.

MK4 added a "Maximum Damage" cap to the game's combo system, automatically breaking off combos if they deal over a set amount of damage to a player and, thus, preventing infinite combos (although this cap can be removed with a code). Unlike Mortal Kombat Trilogy which contained multiple finishing moves of various kinds, Mortal Kombat 4 only gives two Fatalities per character and two Stage Fatalities that can only be done in a certain arena and involve the character throwing the opponent to part of the arena where he can die.

MK4 also contains a game over countdown which showed the player's defeated character falling down what appears to be a never ending well. When the timer hits zero, the camera pans to the character's side. The character then screams as they hit a spike pit with a crunch. "Game Over" then appears.

The following is a list of the characters included in the Mortal Kombat 4 character selection roster.

Plot

Long ago, (before the events that took place in MK1) the Lin Kuei were hired by the sorcerer Quan Chi to steal a map of elements from a Shaolin temple. The Grandmaster sent his most cunning assassin, Sub-Zero, to do the job. Battling through the Shaolin monks who guarded the map, Sub-Zero reached the map room and was accosted by his rival, Scorpion. In a grueling battle, Sub-Zero mercilessly killed Scorpion and escaped the temple with the map. Back at the headquarters of the Lin Kuei, Sub-Zero delivered the map to Quan Chi, who had repaid the Lin Kuei by eliminating all the members of Scorpion's ninja clan the Shirai Ryu, the Lin Kuei's rival clan. Quan Chi also revealed he had hired Scorpion in case Sub-Zero has failed his mission, something that did not settle well with Sub-Zero. Retaining the Lin Kuei's services, Quan Chi had Sub-Zero follow the map to the Temple of Elements, where an amulet of "sentimental value" was resting.

Sub-Zero reached the temple and went through its many challenges and obstacles, eliminating the gods of Wind, Earth, Water, and Fire that protected the amulet. Just as Sub-Zero reached out for it, Quan Chi appeared and took the amulet, saying that it was actually the source of power for a fallen Elder God named Shinnok. Quan Chi disappeared through a portal, and the thunder god Raiden accosted Sub-Zero, ordering him to go to the Netherealm to retrieve the amulet.

Sub-Zero was sent to the Netherealm and was immediately trapped in the Prison of Souls by Quan Chi's guards. There, he was met by the undead spectre of his archnemsis, Scorpion, who blamed Sub-Zero for the destruction of his clan and family. Although Scorpion couldn't die, he was beaten by Sub-Zero and forced to retreat. Sub-Zero escaped and fought Quan Chi's underlings: Kia, Sareena, and Jataaka. He killed Kia and Jataaka, but spared Sareena. Retrieving their transportation crystals, he was able to get to Quan Chi's fortress. Quan Chi then revealed to Sub-Zero that the only reason he was able to retain his mortality was because of the evil in his heart from being the ruthless assassin he had been known as. Suddenly, Sareena appeared and helped Sub-Zero defeat the sorcerer. She then begged Sub-Zero to take her away from the Netherealm, but she was quickly killed by Shinnok, who was now powered by his amulet. Using his cunning, Sub-Zero grabbed the amulet from Shinnok, who then morphed into a giant demon. Rather than facing certain death, Sub-Zero escaped through a portal created by Raiden, and delivered the amulet to the god. When Sub-Zero questioned what Quan Chi said to him, Raiden confirmed it, but reminded the young warrior that only he could change his own fate.

Returning to the Lin Kuei headquarters, Sub-Zero was once again hired by another sorcerer named Shang Tsung. The Lin Kuei warrior was asked to compete in a tournament on Tsung's behalf. It was called Mortal Kombat...


Gameplay

Although Mythologies is classified as an action-adventure game, its play controls are very similar to the 2D Mortal Kombat fighting games. The player has four attack buttons, along with a block button and a run button like in Mortal Kombat 3. The player controls Sub-Zero as they would in a fighting game, including the use of command-based special moves, to fight enemies and venture through levels. A "turn" button is used to change the direction Sub-Zero is facing, while an "action" button is used to pick up or use items. The player also has access to a status screen which keeps tracks of the player's inventory, experience points, and special moves they gain during the game.

The player begins the game with a small health gauge and a limited number of extra lives. As the player progress through the game, they can gain experience points by performing combos against enemies, which are then used to increase their character's strength and gain access to special moves. An "ice meter" will appear after the player begins to acquire special moves. Special moves requires ice power in order to be performed. Health and ice power can be replenish by picking up items (although the ice meter will gradually replenish itself over time as well). The player will also need to retrieve key items.

Passwords are used to keep track of the player's progress.


Development

The making of MKM: SZ spanned about fourteen months from start to finish. The main design team was located at Midway's Chicago offices and consisted of five artists, two programmers and a sound designer. The graphics in MKM: SZ were created using many different techniques. While Sub-Zero and many of the more humanoid characters were created using MK's trademark of digitizing live actors, many of the more ominous enemies as well as all of the backgrounds were done in real time 3D. This combination provides for a more realistic look than has ever been achieved in the previous MK games. Another addition to the MK universe was to use detailed cinematic sequences to help tell the story while the player progresses through the game. This was done by combining live actors with digital elements. The actors were taped in front of a green screen then they were digitally combined with 3D backdrops. The actual video shoot for these sequences took about a week to complete. The crew was kept to a minimum and the entire process from taping to post-production work took about a month.

Cast and characters


Along with the UMK3 roster, MKT adds Baraka, and Raiden as they appeared in MKII. In addition to both characters gaining one new special move each, both characters have brand new sprites for running and standing falls (these animation types weren't introduced until ''Mortal Kombat 3). A new version of Johnny Cage played by a new actor was also introduced as well. He retains all of his regular moves from MKII except for the Split Punch, which had to be excluded since none of the characters from MK3/UMK3 had "reaction" sprites for this particular move. Bosses Goro, Kintaro, Motaro and Shao Kahn, are also now playable.

The PlayStation (PSX), Sega Saturn, and PC versions also contain alternate versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano and Raiden as they appeared in the first or second game, as they were the only actors who returned as special characters in the game; Ho Sung Pak (Liu Kang), Philip Ahn (Shang Tsung), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) and Dan Pesina (Johnny Cage and Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile/Smoke) left Midway prior to the production of MK3 due to royalty disputes. Johnny Cage is the only character to have all new sprites for this game; his new sprites are that of Chris Alexander. Pesina is the actor for the sprites used during Raiden's gameplay, but Sal Divita is used for the versus screen picture. In addition, new sprites were created to show MKII Raiden and Baraka running and falling from a standing position. New frames were also created for the original Kano to replace the old frames used for his victory stance and heart rip Fatality by modifying Kano's MK3 sprites.

A new secret character appears, as well. This character, known as Chameleon, rapidly switches between all the male ninjas (Classic Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Human Smoke, Rain, Reptile, and Ermac) during combat. He is similar to the original Mortal Kombat version of Reptile, but Chameleon changes his color, not just his stance. This character is playable by performing a special button combination. The spine rip Fatality performed by Classic Sub-Zero is a censored version of that featured in the original Mortal Kombat game (when he reaches for the opponent's head, the screen goes black).

Gameplay

Mortal Kombat Trilogy introduces the Aggressor bar, which fills as the combatants fight (twice as much if the opponent is blocking). When the bar fills, the character becomes much faster and stronger for a short period of time.

A finishing move known as a Brutality is featured in this game: it requires the player to perform an 11-button combo which causes their opponent to explode. (Brutalities were also added to the Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES ports of UMK3.) All of the levels that featured a Stage Fatality made it into this game except the pit II as no MK3 characters had the sprites for falling off the bridge.

Many of the characters have brand new special moves and finishing moves. Several have unused special moves never implemented in previous games which made their first official appearance in Mortal Kombat Trilogy. These special moves include MK1 Kano's Spinning Blade move, MKII Kung Lao's Air Torpedo, Goro's Spinning Punch move, Raiden's Lightning that shoots from behind the opponent, and Baraka's Blade Spin move. In addition, Shao Kahn has a throw move and a grab and punch move that is exclusive to this game, and Motaro has added an overhead toss to his arsenal.

Almost every battle arena that has been featured in MKII, MK3, and UMK3 makes an appearance in MKT, however only a handful of backgrounds from the first Mortal Kombat make it into this game (Courtyard, Goro's Lair, The Pit, and The Pit Bottom). The PC, PSX, and Saturn versions only lack The Hidden Portal and Noob Saibot's Dorfen from MK3, while the Nintendo 64 version lacks Kahn's Arena and The Bank from MK2 and MK3, respectively. In some of the Kombat Zones a character can be uppercutted into different backgrounds: The Subway ? The Street, The Bank ? The Rooftop (only in the PC, PS and Saturn versions), The Soul Chamber ? The Balcony, Scorpion's Lair ? Kahn's Kave, Goro's Lair ? The Armory ? Kombat Tomb (N64 exclusive).


Nintendo 64

The Nintendo 64 port exclusively features 3-on-3 simultaneous battles. In the N64 version, like in the arcade, the player has four credits from the start. However, after playing a 2-player match, the player gets an extra credit, while in the CD-ROM versions, anyone can play for free. Free Play needs to be unlocked on the N64 version. The N64 port also has a more cohesive "Supreme Demonstration" feature (which shows every Fatality, Babality, Friendship, Animality, and Brutality for every character) than the PS or Saturn versions (as the latter versions needed to load the Fatalities and thus cannot show every one in the allotted time). This version only uses music from MK3 and it is played through the system's internal synth, resulting in considerably lower quality than the CD versions. However, all ending tunes and music loops used during the "Finish Him/Her" screen are intact unlike the CD-ROM versions.

Due to limitations of cartridge space there are only 31 total characters on N64, instead of 36 in the PSX, Sega Saturn, and PC versions of the game. The N64 version lacks Goro and Kintaro, and the classic versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano, and Raiden. The other versions of the game have both masked and unmasked Sub-Zero whereas the N64 version only has masked Sub-Zero (however, in addition to his own moves, he is able to perform unmasked Sub-Zero's moves as well). Chameleon is replaced with the secret character Khameleon, a grey female ninja, and is present as both a secret opponent and a playable character. While she, too, switches her move sets (making her considerably weaker), she has a cohesive backstory, unlike her male counterpart. The N64 version of the game, like MK3 and UMK3, provides the player with an "Ultimate Kombat Kode" screen after a single player game is over where a 6-digit code can be entered to unlock Human Smoke and Khameleon for normal play.

The N64 game also includes a new level: the Star Bridge, which is The Pit II background with a star-filled sky. Some older backgrounds are also "enhanced" with extra graphics and added animation. Some examples of this are The Portal, which now includes a temple-like building on each side of the stage, and the Kahn's Kave, which has animated clouds and a glowing floor added to it. The sky of The Pit I stage has been redone in all versions: the PlayStation, PC, and Saturn versions feature a sky almost identical to that of The Pit II, while the N64 version features a pitch-black, star-filled sky. Kahn's Arena no longer has the sprites of Kano and Sonya in the background (most likely due to storyline reasons). Living Forest also no longer has sprites of Smoke and Jade emerging in the background as they are playable characters of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. The N64's Lost Bridge also has Hornbuckle and Blaze appear at random in its background. The N64's Graveyard stage has more names on the gravestones near the front: as well as the original Midway design team of MK3, names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added (the date of death on the stones was changed, from April 1, 1995 to September 30, 1996 to the creators' birthdates).

In this version there are two secret menus (blue question mark and red question mark) because not all the playable characters are unlocked from the start. Motaro and Shao Kahn are given Fatalities to perform, either as computer-controlled or regularly controlled characters. Johnny Cage has two Fatalities that he had in MKII (though one is performed differently; instead of ripping an opponent in half at his/her waist, he performs a powerful Shadow Kick move that knocks out the middle section of this opponent's torso). He also has new/different animations whenever a Fatality has been performed on him are different (an example is Kabal's Head Inflation, where in the other versions his shades are placed on the top of his head while in the N64 version his glasses are enlarged with his head). Nightwolf has a very different Friendship move exclusive to this version, which he pulls out 3 hatchets and begins to juggle as opposed to turning into Raiden since this character returned as a playable character to this game (although in the other versions, Nightwolf has his original MK3 Friendship move). In addition, many frames of animation had to be cut from each character in the game and Rain's stance is the same as Reptile's.

They intend to transform Japan into a stage for their talents.
[edit] Story

While shopping in Oedo Town, Goemon and Ebisumaru feel the ground quake as a peach-shaped flying object sails overhead. The vessel fires a laser at Oedo Castle, turning it into a European-style castle with spires and flags. Worried for the safety of the Lord of Oedo and his daughter, Goemon and Ebisumaru retrieve a chain pipe from Mt. Fuji and assault the castle. Inside is Baron, a member of the fashion-loving Gang of Four who reveals he was sent to turn the castle into a stage. Goemon shrugs him off and defeats the King Robot Congo to free the Lord and find a "miracle item". The Lord asks Goemon to catch them and gives a Super Pass for access to the roads of Japan.

Goemon sets out to the Wise Man's house for assistance, but the house explodes as he approaches. A fuming Baron comes forth and mans his kabuki robot. Goemon finds a Triton shell in the rubble that can call Impact, who lays ruin to the kabuki robot. In Zazen Town, Goemon finds Yae, who claims the troublemakers responsible are Flake Gang members named the Peach Mountain Shoguns. Yae joins Goemon, and they learn that children with dancing talent have been kidnapped around the region. In Zazen, Goemon defeats a strong man blocking a bridge leading out of the town. Ashamed, the man offers Goemon the mechanical robot Sasuke, thrown there by the explosion of the Wise Man's house.[9] Goemon accepts the unconscious, powerless Sasuke and walks to Kii-Awaji island, where the dragon-powered passenger ferry has been stopped by the dragon's sudden craze. Goemon teleports to the dragon and finds a Gang of Four member named Colon who used the dragon to kidnap children; he then breaks Colon's mind-control device. The dragon turns back to human and crashes near a shrine.

The human calls himself Koryuta, son of the Dragon God, and apologizes for the kidnappings. He pledges help in transporting the heroes across Japan, and claims the kids are at the Dogo Hot Springs. Goemon travels to Iyo but finds the Hot Springs closed; the only entrance is a mouse hole. He learns from travelers that sweets in the Zazen Town shrine can make a person smaller. Ebisumaru offers to steal the sweets. With the dwarf power the group infiltrate the Ghost Toys Castle, a dark house of traps, toys, and a giant pool table. Colon faces Goemon with the robot Dharmanyo, but is crushed and lets go his miracle item. The hidden man aboard the peach ship at Oedo comes out calling himself Spring Breeze Dancin'. He pokes fun at the group with nicknames and instructs Colon to retreat. With the children liberated, Goemon follows Colon to the Chu-goku Region, where he revives Sasuke with two batteries. They enter the Festival Temple, a Peach Mountain base.

They destroy a guard robot, prompting Gang of Four member Sharon to appear with Kitty Lily, the second leader of the Peach Mountain Shoguns. Lily boasts that Kyushu is a stage and asks Sharon to return to base after buying some foundation. Alarmed, Goemon and friends rush off to the bridge to Kyushu and find Omitsu on her way to deliver dumplings. Stunned by Omitsu's seeming ruggedness, Goemon forgets to warn her of danger, and the island rises into odd thunder clouds in the sky. A fortune teller instructs the group to set out north to Mount Fear to find a way to Kyushu. After necessary weight training to remove obstacles, Goemon finds the northeast Festival Village and learns of a psychic witch. The witch summons Wise Man, who tells Goemon to gather the fourth miracle items at the Stone Circle near Festival Village for passage into outer space and Kyushu. Goemon investigates reports of stolen food in the village while Yae undergoes training to become a mermaid. The two paths converge when Yae finds the Gourmet Submarine, a Peach Mountain vessel containing hordes of food. After sidestepping grills and swimming through gallons of soup, Goemon confronts Poron, the final weirdo, who jokes that he lost the last miracle item in Zazen Town.

Lily enters by hologram to ridicule the party, but is rudely interrupted by Dancin', who continues to call Goemon "Fernandez". Dancin' instructs Poron to activate the ship's self-destruct sequence. Goemon escapes by calling Impact and defeats a mermaid giant robot. In Zazen Town, a kappa named Kihachi desires to trade the miracle item for cucumber made by the priest's son. The son sits on a precipice inaccessible save through jumping training; Sasuke volunteers in the Chu-goku Region and acquires the miracle item. At the Stone Circle, the Pemopemo God awakens and asks the heroes if they have the courage to venture to outer space. Goemon affirms their decision and the group enters Kyushu through the Gorgeous Music Castle. They discover Sogen Town has been converted to a garden city with European architecture. Goemon locates Omitsu and learns that Dancin' and Lily can be found past a rigid gate—accessible only with the help of Wise Man.

Stunned to find him alive, Goemon learns that in exchange for building the Instant Stage Beam and mechanical robots, the Peach Mountain Shoguns gave Wise Man five car magazines and a muscle car poster.[13] Enraged to learn of his home's demise, Wise Man helps Goemon enter the castle. Kitty Lily and Dancin' confront the heroes with the elaborate musical number Gorgeous My Stage before a self-destruct sequence begins. Goemon summons Impact to fly into outer space, where he thwarts the giant peach ship Balberra and duels Lily and Dancin' in their personal battle robot. Dancin' mocks Goemon in defeat, and Impact sends their robot's head far into outer space to reveal a picture of Dancin' and Lily smiling among the stars. Goemon returns to Japan to find a horde of girls rushing towards him, and awaits their praise for saving Japan. The group is shocked to find the girls angry over the apparent death of their idol, Spring Breeze Dancin'.

Critical Reviews

NASCAR 99 received mixed reviews upon its release. The game was praised for its realistic graphics regarding the cars, although critics felt that the other graphics were "lacking". Also, critics stated that the game was "repetitive and boring," mainly because of the 17 tracks included in the game, only 2 are road-courses (Watkins Glen and Sears Point), and the rest are a mix of ovals, tri-ovals, quad ovals, and short tracks.

Gameplay

The gameplay is largely the same as the Midway's NBA Jam games, with some additions. One of the most prominent additions is the "Create Player" feature, which allows players to create a custom basketball player, specifying height, weight, power, shooting and defensive skills using a limited number of attribute points. Created players can be made more powerful as players earn additional attribute points by winning games.

The game retains many of the same rules of NBA Jam Tournament Edition, including the two-on-two match ups, statistics tracking, legal pushing and "on fire" mode. Additions to the gameplay include spin moves, alley oops and double slam dunks - a slam dunk performed after one team member in the middle of a dunk passes to the other member. Alley-oops and double dunks can trigger the new "team fire" mode in which both team members are on fire.

The player can select from any of the 29 NBA teams then in existence and match them in four quarters of NBA basketball (three minutes each), with three minute overtimes if necessary. Just as in the NBA Jam games, the game can keep track of the teams a player has beaten using a player's created ID and PIN. Optionally, the player can load their created player. Players using their ID face off against a series of NBA teams, starting with the Vancouver Grizzlies and ending with the Chicago Bulls (who were on their way to being NBA champions at the time of the game's release). After beating all 29 teams, the player faces off against a number of secret characters.

Overview

Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 2 on 2 play with the ability to pick two players from any NBA team's starting line-up for the first half and can choose again for the second. In addition, after a player makes 3 consecutive shots he becomes "on fire", which allows him to easily make shots from almost anywhere, as well as goaltend without penalty and push opponents without being charged a foul. Play otherwise is similar to NBA rules. The arcade version accommodates up to 4 players, as do the home versions produced for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation and Dreamcast.

The players featured in the game included many of the most popular players of the particular year and era of the NBA season. But, like the previous games in the arcade-style basketball series—many players were left out and each team has a limited amount of players per position to chose from for the 2 on 2 gameplay.

As with the previous NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime games, the game contains many secret characters. The arcade version features the Universal Monsters Frankenstein's monster, Bride of Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon as secret characters.

Several Midway Games employees are also playable characters. Some of the available players include Mark Turmell, Rob Gatson, Mark Guidarelli, Dan Thompson, Jeff Johnson, Jason Skiles, Sal DiVita, Jennifer Hedrick, Eugene Geer, Matt Gilmore, Tim Bryant, Jim Gentile, John Root, Jon Hey, Andy Eloff, Mike Lynch, Dave Grossman, Larry Wotman, Tim Moran, Willie Morris, Greg Cutler, and Chad Edmunds.

The game-time commentary is particularly varied and colorful for basketball games of that period, featuring such phrases as "The dejection of the rejection!" "He just flat-out leveled him!" as well as "With the silky smooth move!" and "Look Ma, no rim!"

The original announcer from NBA Jam, Tim Kitzrow, returned, after Midway used the Bulls radio announcer Neil Funk in NBA Hangtime. Jon Hey produced all the sound, music and script save for the NBC basketball theme Roundball Rock by John Tesh. At the time, the music was influenced by 2Pac and Dr. Dre's California Love and Master P's Make 'em say uhh and previous NBA Themes written by Jon Hey for NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime.

The gameplay is mostly a fighting game between the evas and angels. Excluding mission 8 (An angel takes over an eva). There are three ways the player can play. The most common gameplays is Plain Fighting, where the player takes control of an eva on a "3D-2D" Course. Walking back and forth, attacking the enemy. Another gameplay style used in the game is weponring. Various parts of the game include minigames as missions, where the player takes control of the eva's weponring in order to accomplish a mission or objective. The final gameplay element used only in mission 12 is free-for-all. Where the player is still on a "3D-2D" Plain, however now can move freely back and forth to defend him/her-self from opposing forces. This mode is used in mission 12 only because it is best suited for completing objectives (Military forces/MP evas). There are also modes outside the missions, such as training mode. In this mode you select an eva (after being unlocked in story mode) and practice with shooting un-collared poly-models of Sachiel, based on where and how well you shoot him. And versus mode. This mode is unlockable by cheat codes. Where two players can select a different eva with different weapons.

The game has 13 missions, each focusing on one of the major enemies of the series.

    Mission 1: Sachiel
    Mission 2: Shamshel

_________________________
*
The New Tetris is a puzzle video game for the Nintendo 64. The game was developed by H2O Entertainment and published by Nintendo, based on the latter's popular Tetris series. The game was originally released on July 31, 1999 in North America.

The game is notable for showing scenic fly-bys of famous structures (for examples the Sphinx, the Pantheon, Saint Basil's Cathedral, a Mayan temple, and others) rendered in realtime. This is relatively difficult for the Nintendo 64 hardware to accomplish at the quality that is achieved. The New Tetris also features a multiplayer mode with up to four players and an ethnically themed electronic dance music soundtrack by Neil D. Voss, who also composed the award-winning music for Tetrisphere.

Game differences

There are several key differences in gameplay from the original Tetris. First, in addition to clearing lines, one can also form 4x4 large squares of four pieces to form 'blocks'. When a block is created, it turns solid gold or silver, depending on the makeup of the block—a block built from all the same kind of piece becomes a golden block or "monosquare", while any other combination becomes a silver block or "multisquare". Blocks can only be constructed from whole pieces: if any part of a piece has been cleared, then it cannot be used to form a block. When a line that has pieces from a block is cleared, it earns more points.[1]

Second, in order to aid in the planning of building blocks, the game shows three upcoming pieces and has a "storage area" where a spare piece can be stored. If the piece in the storage area is more desirable than the currently falling piece, the player can press the L button to swap the currently falling piece with the stored piece.
Screenshot of The New Tetris, demonstrating a strategy for building 4x4 squares.

One other feature is that the rotation is much more flexible than in traditional Tetris games, trying several slight nudges, which players have called "wall kicks",[2] before finding one where the tetromino fits. Some of these compensations move the pieces away from walls even "over" other pieces. In fact, the game rewards players for performing these seemingly impossible "spin moves": If a line is cleared by doing a spin move, all the pieces above or below the spin move break apart into individual blocks and fall down, possibly clearing many lines and filling in empty spaces in the bottom portion of the play area. Unfortunately, the spin move process causes golden and silver blocks to become ordinary pieces again and so they no longer carry their multiplier when cleared.

Tetris Worlds includes the rules of The New Tetris under the name "Square Tetris", with even more flexible wall kick rules, although the rule for what constitutes a spin move differs 

Trivia:

The Lead programmer on The New Tetris, David Pridie, placed a secret hidden rant within the code which was dumped by hackers soon after the release of the game.

You might play in rain, snow or mud. And don't forget about those night games! Secret players, tons of power-ups and wild camera action will keep your adrenaline pumping!


NFL years

In the original Blitz games (beginning in 1997), all NFL teams appeared (however the Houston Texans and Cleveland Browns did not have a team), but there were several differences in the rules to make Blitz different from standard football games. After the commercial failure of Blitz Pro, Midway did not release a Blitz in 2004 for the first time since the series began. Blitz Pro was thought to be the last NFL Blitz game, then Blitz: The League came out. When NFL Blitz was released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, it was referred to as "the best football game ever made" by GameSpot.com



Rules differences

In 1997, seven players are on the field per side (as opposed to eleven). Not only were there fewer players, but positions were flexible at best. Wide receivers could be known to run the ball and sometimes pass, and defensive players were all crosses between pass rushers and defensive backs. 2002 saw an increase to eight players and NFL Blitz Pro (released in 2003) increased to eleven.

Unlike the NFL, pass interference is allowed, as are late hits, showboating and excessive celebrations.

There are no timeouts, but the clock stops after every play, and extra points after touchdowns are claimed to be automatic, unless it is chosen to go for two points. However, although rare, choosing an automatic extra point can sometimes result in the extra point being missed if the kicking team is winning by a wide margin.

Quarters have been shortened to two minutes (default setting) with a faster running timer than real time. For most releases, a first down would mean you would have to go 30 yards, instead of ten.

Description

In 1834 on London's blackest eve, a secret cult known as The Brotherhood of Hecate rediscovered the key to man's unholiest fears. It was through this arcane act of terror that the evil leader of the Brotherhood, Adam Crowley, swore to take over the world... Ever since this fateful night, not a London street, alley or town square has escaped the screams of "Nightmare Creatures!"

Plot

The story behind Nightmare Creatures draws upon gothic horror elements of the 19th century. The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city, and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only nightmarish creatures. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London.

The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.

A book is dropped off at the home of Ignatius Blackward, a priest and occult expert. He finds it is the lost diary of Samuel Pepys, which contains the Brotherhood's research. Knowing he needs help, Ignatius sends the diary to a renowned American immunologist named Dr. Jean Franciscus of New Orleans, who shows up with his daughter Nadia. The doctor is murdered and the book stolen. At the funeral, Ignatius and Nadia are approached by a man who gives them a note reading: "Know about Adam Crowley, Brotherhood of Hecate --- HVHJ." Ignatius and Nadia head out to an address listed on the note, hoping to seek out Crowley and to neutralize the monsters.

NUCLEAR STRIKE 64 for the N64 features more enemies than ever before, bigger explosions, improved enemy targeting, and photo-realistic environments! Control more than ten different attack vehicles on smart battlefields, where the AI reacts to the player's behavior!

An ex-CIA operative named Colonel LeMonde (played by Bo Hopkins) has stolen a nuclear warhead. It is up to the player to find the warhead before LeMonde uses it for nefarious purposes. Among the locations visited is the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. The playable vehicles include the Super Apache helicopter, a Vietnam War-era UH-1 "Huey" gunship, a Harrier ground attack fighter, a fictional V/STOL variant of the A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack fighter, tanks, a hovercraft, and more. Nuclear Strike also brought the RAH-66 Comanche back; this time it had a wing-tip system setup, unlike in Jungle Strike.

New features include an on-screen radar and a playback option to replay previous mission cut-scenes. It features several new characters as well as many returning from Soviet Strike, General Earl, "Hack", Andrea Grey, and a brief appearance by Nick Arnold (Found KIA in objective 2 of the first mission). The game also features two new characters: Southeast Asian rebel Naja and Australian mercenary Harding Cash.

The N64 version of the game is more of a condensed version of the game rather than a direct port, with missions being rearranged and shorter; this was due to technical limitations of the N64 (notably the inability to play movies) versus the PlayStation, as well as series co-Director Tony Barnes' return to lead the design and implementation of the N64 version.

The classes determine the type of attacks the character can use in battle, what equipment it can carry, as well as effects on the unit's statistics. Many classes are most efficient in certain positions of a unit. All classes are divided into 3 major groups: Male, female, and non-human.

Story

The player character wakes up, and thinks "Oh boy, I'm 10 today, time to become a monster breeder". After getting and hatching their first monster egg, the player begins their journey raising monsters to fight.

Gameplay

The game is a 3D RPG in which the player character walks around the world, collecting requests from people and raising his monsters. The requests are fairly standard RPG fare, such as "collect a tasty cake for Ms. Whoever", as are the Pokémon-style, turn based battles. Less like Pokémon are the monsters themselves. Every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, it gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters levels up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.

Paper Mario
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Action > Role Playing Game
Release Year: 2001
Developer: Intelligent Systems
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: Single-player
Alternate Title: Mario Story
_________________________
*
Gameplay

Paper Mario combines traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with concepts and features from the Mario series. For the majority of the games, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Many of the game's puzzles and boundaries are based upon the abilities of Mario's partners, who each have a specialised skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange between them at any time. These characters also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles, where damage inflicted against them results in temporary paralysis as the characters do not have individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game are similar to those in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulate in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time.

Progression through Paper Mario depends upon interaction with the game's non-player characters (NPCs), who will often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can also be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a set number of Badge Points (BP), meaning Mario can only equip a limited number of badges at a time.[8] Princess Peach is playable at particular points in the game as a recurring sidequest. The objectives and actions of each transition to Peach vary, although most are stealth-based.


Plot and setting

The game is set in Mushroom Kingdom, beginning as Mario and Luigi are relaxing in their house when the mail Parakoopa, Parakarry, arrives with a letter. Mario sends Luigi to fetch the mail, which turns out to be an invitation from Peach to a party. Mario and Luigi then head to the castle, and as Mario is about to have some quiet time with Peach, Bowser appears. After Bowser's invasion and victory over Mario, the castle becomes attached to Bowser's fortress, which serves as the location for playable side quests of the kidnapped Peach. In the main quest, Mario tries to retrieve all of the Star Spirits on land,[8] where most of the locations are linked to the central Toad Town, which acts as the game's hub area. The story's main conflict arises when Bowser invades Star Haven, the residence for the seven Star Spirits, and steals the Star Rod.


Story and characters

The game's story centers on Mario as he tries to reclaim the seven Star Spirits, who have been incarcerated in playing cards by Bowser and Kammy Koopa. Their combined power is required to negate the effects of the Star Rod, which makes Bowser invincible. Once Mario rescues all of them, he uses their assistance to defeat Bowser and rescue Peach. The story is presented in the context of a novel, with each adventure involving the rescue of a Star Spirit denoted as a single chapter. Peach is playable between chapters, where she allies with a star named Twink in the castle to relay vital information to Mario regarding his quest. During the final boss scene, Peach gives Twink a wish to defeat Bowser's assistant, Kammy Koopa.

Mario allies with eight partners in total, each of whom represents a different type of enemy from the Mario series. These allies are:

    Goombario (Kurio (????)) the Goomba, who has the ability to tell the player about any character, any environment, and any enemy.
    Kooper (Kameki (????)) the Koopa, with the ability to throw his shell at otherwise unreachable objects.
    Bombette (Pinky (???? Pinki?)) the Bob-omb, with the ability to blow up weak parts of walls.
    Parakarry (Paretta (?????) the Paratroopa, with the ability to help Mario cross gaps too large to jump across.
    Lady Bow (Resaresa (?????)) the Boo, with the ability to make Mario become invisible and transparent.
    Watt (Akarin (?????)) the Li'l Sparky, with the ability to light up rooms (also, the only ally in the game with the ability to penetrate an enemy's defenses). Also has the ability to see hidden objects.
    Sushie (Opuku (????)) the Cheep-Cheep, with the ability to allow Mario to swim
    Lakilester (Pokopi (???? Pokopi?)) the Lakitu, with the ability to allow Mario to traverse dangerous environments, such as spikes.

Near the end of the game, Mario recounts his tale to Luigi, who had remained at home while Mario went on the adventure.

Gameplay

Of all the collectible parts in the game 8 of them the player has when starting, 12 of them are Special Upgrade items that are unlocked when the player meets a required accomplishment in A Class of the 'Race Series' Mode. There are four Class type of race, Class C, Class B, Class A, and Class AA. "You start the game in Class C. You can move up to the next Class when you come in 3rd Place or better on all courses." [1] After beating all 9 tracks the next Class is unlocked, the tracks remain the same but the items the player can use become greater and the difficulty of beating the other racers becomes harder. Each Class, allows only certain parts to be used on its tracks by giving each part its own point values, allowing only so many points to be used in that Class. The player acquires more parts by winning a track, they are then rewarded with the option of taking opponents car parts, or trading with them. The weapons can be used to knock out opponents, as well as for an extra boost of speed as with the Turbo Boost. Two other special techniques to use while driving are the barrel roll, and Popping a wheelie. The Nine tracks are as follows:

    Country Arena
    Lakeside
    Harbor
    Mountain
    Ruins
    Volcano
    Alpine
    Caves
    Ice


Modes

'Race Series' is the standard one- or two-player race mode where the goal is to beat all the tracks in each class.
'Time Trial' allows the player to race any of the tracks, and save it as a 'Ghost Racer' and then load the Ghost to try to beat their own best times.
'VS' Versus mode allows up to four players to compete against each other on any of the nine tracks, or one or two players on the 'New Track' user-designed courses.
'New Track' allows the player to create their own track on a 24 by 24 grid, with 200 track pieces, On or Off Road, and Circuit or Stage (point to point) courses. These tracks can only be played in Versus or Time Trial modes.


The Choro Q video games are a series of console games based on Takara's Choro Q toy cars (also known as Penny Racers in English-speaking markets). The games have been localised for Western release under many different names, including Gadget Racers, Penny Racers and Road Trip.

Most of these games were developed by external companies, although they are usually credited to Takara since the developers' name rarely appears outside of the ending credits. Some of these developers include Tamsoft (Choro Q, Choro Q 2 and Choro Q 3), Barnhouse Effect (Shin Combat Choro Q, Choro Q HG and Choro Q HG 4) and E-game (Choro Q Wonderful, Choro Q HG 2 and Choro Q HG 3). Most are auto racing games with extensive opportunities for customisation, often including RPG-style elements such as towns and side-quests.

Overseas releases

Only three games in the series were released outside of Japan prior to 2001 (including the 1984 MSX game by Taito Corporation, which is unrelated to the later Choro Q titles) - Choro Q for the PlayStation (released in Europe only as Penny Racers) and Choro Q 64 for the Nintendo 64 (released in North America and Europe as Penny Racers). However, since 2001 many of the titles have been released in the US and PAL regions as budget titles, by publishers including Conspiracy Entertainment, Midas Interactive Entertainment and Play It!.

Perfect Dark
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Shooter > First Person
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Rare
Publisher: Rare, Nintendo
Players: Single-player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Perfect Dark is set in the year 2023 against the backdrop of an interstellar war between two races: the Maians, who resemble the stereotypical grey alien; and the Skedar, reptile-like extraterrestrials who can disguise themselves as Scandinavian humans, bearing similarities to Nordic aliens. Using this disguise, they can interact with humans on Earth without looking too overtly suspicious. Meanwhile on Earth, there is an on-going rivalry between two factions. The Carrington Institute, a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians; and dataDyne, a sinister defense contractor corporation led by Cassandra De Vries, who secretly made a deal with a group of Scandinavians: she agreed to assist them in constructing an AI to crack the codes of a "Cetan" alien ship buried on the ocean floor. In return, the Scandinavians promised to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.

The player is cast as Joanna Dark, an agent of the Carrington Institute, whose impeccable scores in training have earned her the codename "Perfect Dark". On her first mission, she is sent to rescue a scientist named Dr. Caroll from the dataDyne skyscraper. It is revealed that Dr. Caroll is in fact the AI created by dataDyne, who felt that dataDyne has betrayed ethical and moral standards. After the operation, Carrington is held captive at his private villa by dataDyne soldiers and forced to tell them where Dr. Caroll has been hidden. Once Joanna rescues Carrington, he informs her that Dr. Caroll has been taken to the G5 Corporation headquarters in Chicago, which is suspected to be a front for dataDyne. As a result, Joanna is sent to Chicago to uncover dataDyne's plans. She learns that dataDyne and their conspirators plan to kidnap the President of the United States in order to get access to a deep sea research vessel which will allow the conspirators to reach the Cetan ship. Despite the President being in danger, Carrington alerts Joanna that a Maian craft was shot down near Area 51 and sends her to rescue any survivors from the base.[5] While inside the base, she rescues one survivor, a Maian Protector named Elvis who is key in stopping the conspiracy.

As the President of the United States refuses to loan dataDyne the research vessel, the conspirators plot to kill him and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone.[4] To accomplish their plans, an NSA strike team led by Trent Easton invades the air base where Air Force One will be departing from. When Joanna foils this strike, the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself, which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it. Having survived the crash, Joanna eliminates the president's clone and rescues the real president. Due to the failure of Trent Easton to kill the president, he is killed by one particular scandinavian known as Mr. Blonde, who turns out to be a Skedar. Unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Carrington Institute learns that the Cetan ship contains a megaweapon and that the conspirators are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on the Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld.[6]

Without permission from the president, dataDyne elect to hijack the deep sea vessel and take it to the ancient alien spacecraft. With the help of Elvis, Joanna follows where she finds a reprogrammed Dr. Caroll decoding the megaweapon. She replaces its current personality with a backup of the original, and the restored Dr. Carroll sets the weapon to self-destruct in order to protect Earth. In retaliation, the Skedar kill Cassandra and launch a strike on the Carrington Institute, capturing Joanna and taking her to their homeworld. Elvis rescues her and she then kills the Skedar High Priest, leaving the Skedar in disarray. The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the Skedar planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the Maian navy.

Gameplay

Perfect Dark features many elements that are typical of a first-person shooter game, including a range of weapons to collect, enemies to defeat and distinct environments to explore. Although Perfect Dark is not set in the James Bond universe, the gameplay is extremely similar to that of its predecessor and many of its features were retained, such as the ability to use stealth to tackle missions, and objectives that vary with the difficulty setting.

The weapons of Perfect Dark include handguns, rifles, submachine guns, a shotgun, rocket launchers, combat knives, grenade launchers, various explosives, and several extraterrestrial weapons. Almost all of the weapons in the game have two modes of fire: a primary mode in which the weapon is used in a typical fashion, and a secondary mode which tends to use the weapon in a more unconventional manner, such as pistol-whipping or proximity detonation. Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, and certain guns can be used in duplicate, one in each hand. Unlike in GoldenEye 007, where the guns were simply dipped below vision during reloading, Perfect Dark's weapons all feature unique and visible reload sequences.

Alternate Title: Pilot Wings 64

Description

Forget about those other flying games. This is the ultimate flight experience! Pilotwings 64 carries you off into a vast three-dimensional environment. Pilot several different vehicles and take in breathtaking sights! Successfully complete flight tests to earn your flight badge. Get a high enough score and you'll get a chance at bonus games such as Cannonball and Sky Diving! Soar into the wild blue yonder with Pilotwings 64!


Gameplay

Pilotwings 64 is a 3D flight simulator in which the player must complete a variety of missions involving different airborne vehicles and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight.[4][5] The tests presented to the player require him or her to complete an objective in order to earn a license for the given event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, softness of landing, and similar criteria. The player is awarded either a bronze, silver, or gold license based on the number of points attained.[4][6] More difficult tests become available as the player progresses.

There are three main events in Pilotwings 64 required to complete the game, each of which has its own objectives and unique flight controls centered around the Nintendo 64 controller's single analog stick. The first, hang gliding, usually requires the player to fly through a series of floating marker rings or snap a photograph of a particular piece of scenery before landing in a target area.[4][6] The player's movement is affected by wind currents and altitude can be gained by flying through thermal columns. The second event is the "Rocket Belt", a jet pack that allows the player to move and gain height as well as hover, tilt, and rotate in the air using the belt's equipped thrusters. Goals entail flying through rings or popping large balloons before landing.[4][6] The third event, the gyrocopter, challenges the player to take off and land on a runway after completing objectives like navigating a path of rings or destroying targets with missiles.[4][6] Pilotwings 64 also features several bonus events that are unlocked if the player performs well in the main missions.[4] The player can also earn medals on many of these events. They include skydiving, a human cannonball event, and the "Jumble Hopper", which grants the player special spring-loaded boots to be used in bouncing across the landscape to an end space.[4][6] Lastly, Pilotwings 64 features a "Birdman" mode that puts the character in a bird suit and gives players the opportunity to freely explore the game's detailed, object-dense environments set among its four distinct islands.[4] One of the islands is based on the United States, and has geographical replications of famous landmarks including the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore and major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York City.[4][5][6] Representations of Nintendo characters and many other interesting quirks can be found in the landscapes of the game.

Pokemon Puzzle League
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Puzzle
Release Year: 2000
Developer: NST, Intelligent Systems
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: 1 to 2
_________________________
*
Description

Discover the most frantic, frenzied, fun-filled Pokémon challenge ever--Pokémon Puzzle League! Line up three or more blocks of the same type to clear them off the screen. Create chains and combos to send garbage to your opponent. Collect badges from other Pokémon trainers to earn the right to enter the ultimate competition... a battle against the mysterious Puzzle Master!


Gameplay

Pokémon Puzzle League features the same gameplay as in Panel de Pon. The objective is to clear blocks from the playfield by arranging them in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. A continuous stream of new blocks pushes up from the bottom of the playfield, causing the entire playfield to rise continuously. If the blocks reach the top of the playfield, the player loses. The player can temporarily stop the progression of blocks by scoring combos and chains, and in two-player battles, these actions also cause garbage blocks to stack on top of the opponent's playfield.

Unlike its predecessors, Pokémon Puzzle League features a 3D mode in addition to the traditional 2D mode. In this mode, gameplay takes place on a cylinder with an effective width of 18 blocks, compared to the six-block width of the flat 2D field. It also features the original block design from Panel de Pon and Tetris Attack, as well as a Pokémon-oriented design (which is selected by default).

In two-player games, players can select one of fourteen Pokémon trainers to play as. Unlike most Pokémon games, trainer and Pokémon selection are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay whatsoever.

Characters

The characters in Pokémon Puzzle League either come from the anime and were once exclusive to it, like Ash Ketchum, Tracey Sketchit, and Gary Oak or have appeared in previous Pokémon games but appear in the game as they do in the anime like Misty, Brock, and Giovanni. There are 16 playable characters in the game. In the 1P Stadium, only Ash is playable and Gary's Pokémon, Nidoran?, Growlithe, and Krabby, will fully be evolved into Nidoqueen, Arcanine, and Kingler, respectively, in Hard mode, Very Hard mode, and Super Hard mode when challenging him the second time. These fully evolved Pokémon are not playable with Gary.



Featured Gameplay Modes



1P Stadium

This is the main story-based mode of the game. The player takes on the role of Ash and plays through a linear tournament against other Pokémon trainers to become the Pokémon Puzzle Master. Each round is played against a computer opponent in a single Versus round, in which scoring combos and chains sends garbage blocks to the opponent's playfield. The player may choose from one of five difficulty levels before starting the tournament.

Spa Service

Team Rocket steals the player's Pokémon, forcing the player to play through a series of stages in which the members of Team Rocket put on various disguises. Each stage requires the player to clear blocks down to a predetermined "clear line" - the player passes a stage when there are no blocks above the line. The player also encounters two stages in which the goal is to score combos and chains to defeat an opponent. The first of these stages takes place against "Team Rocket 2" (Butch and Cassidy), and is optional (losing does not affect the outcome of the game). The final stage takes place against Giovanni, and the player must pass this stage to win.

Stages start in 2D mode, but eventually switch to 3D about halfway through the game. Spa Service Mode is equivalent to Story Mode in Panel de Pon.

Time Zone

The player plays on a single 2D or 3D playfield for two minutes and attempts to score as many points as possible.
 
2P Stadium

This mode allows two players to play against one another in three competitive games. 2P Versus Mode plays identically to 1P Stadium - the objective is for one player to cause the other to lose by filling their playfield. Each player can send garbage blocks to the other's playfield by scoring combos and chains.

Players can also play in Spa Service Mode, in which the objective is to clear blocks down to the clear line before the other player does, or Time Zone Mode, in which the objective is to score more points than the other player in two minutes.

All two-player modes can be played in 2D and 3D, and each player chooses a trainer to play as. By default, games are played in best-of-5 matches, though this can be changed in the Options menu.

Marathon

The player plays in either 2D or 3D mode, chooses an overall difficulty level and a starting speed level, and plays for as long as possible, scoring as many points as possible. This is equivalent to "Endless Mode" in Panel de Pon.

 Puzzle University

This mode presents the player with a series of puzzles in which the player must clear all the blocks in a predetermined number of moves. There are multiple classes of puzzles, spanning simple "switch the correct blocks" puzzles, to chain puzzles where timing is important, as well as 3D puzzles. Once all the puzzles in the main mode have been completed, the player can access a second set of more difficult puzzles by entering a code on the controller. This is equivalent to "Puzzle Mode" in the Game Boy version of Tetris Attack; however, Puzzle University also provides a puzzle editor, in which the player can create and play their own 2D puzzles, while the Game Boy version of Tetris Attack never did have that feature.

Professor Oak's Lab

Contains several non-interactive tutorials describing both basic and advanced techniques.

Mimic Mansion

Hosted by Tracey Sketchit, this area also contains a number of tutorials showing various techniques. Unlike Oak's Lab, techniques are broken up into several categories and many skill levels, from beginner to advanced, and can be presented both non-interactively and interactively. In Interactive mode, Tracey first shows the player a set of moves, then has the player repeat those moves to achieve the same end.

Mimic Mansion also provides a "Super Easy" gameplay mode which plays identically to Marathon Mode, except that gameplay is overall much slower than normal, and the speed level never increases beyond 1. Scores are not stored from this mode.

Pokémon Center

This section provides access to player records, trainer profiles, and game options.


Development
 
Music

Background music for this game is based on the Pokémon 2BA Master CD, and the song "Catch Me if You Can" from Pokémon: The First Movie's short feature Pikachu's Vacation (as well as the score for the movie itself). Some music also comes from the anime.

 Graphics

The cutscene graphics match the animation of the anime. This game was also known for being one of the few N64 games to have FMVs, and the only one to have crisp, clear, full screen, VHS-quality FMVs, with the only quality suffering being framerate (other games featuring FMVs, such as Resident Evil 2 and Wheel of Fortune, had the videos shown either in tiny boxes in the corner of the screen or in widescreen format, and the quality was usually very grainy).

Gameplay

While regarded by many as purely a system port with a renovated Pokémon scheme, improvements in technology from previous consoles to the Nintendo 64 drastically changed the single and multiplayer experiences. The immediate upgrade in pure processing power allows players to navigate between blocks much faster, leading to elite play both on the console as well as on computer emulators where users can take advantage of a much speedier keyboard. Though never massively widespread, the emulators led to high level online play when there was no such online support for the console.

In addition, the Nintendo 64's more powerful processor allowed for a much more sophisticated computer AI for the 1P Stadium mode. This AI combined the faster navigation with such complex attack and defense routines that developers added not just one, but two extra difficulty levels for advanced players. There is one notable absence however, and that is the lack of play against a computer player in 3D mode for 1P stadium. If a player wants to face a computer player in 3D mode, they must do so by changing the second player to a computer one via the options mode, so that in the 2P stadium mode, the opponent faced will be CPU. Note that all selections usually made by the second player, such as character selection will still have to be entered via the second controller. This is great for practicing against level 10 computer players. The player can then select to face the computer in 3D mode if they wish. However, when facing the computer in any 3D mode, the AI becomes erratic, and usually self defeats. There is a small note in the instruction manual explaining the lack of AI for 3D mode.

Description

The Professor has asked you to capture the Wild Pokemon of Pokémon island...on film! Tour the island in your ZERO-ONE vehicle and snap pictures of Pokémon in their natural habitat. Wild Pokémon are often camera-shy, so you'll have to use special items to bring them out in the open. Only the best shots will do for the Professor's Pokémon Report, so sharpen your photography skills and get ready to SNAP!


Todd Snap (???, Tooru?), a Pokémon photographer, is summoned by Professor Oak to an unusual island to help him with a report. Oak needs quality pictures to accompany his scientific findings, and knows from past experience that Todd is the right person for the job. Pokémon Island, which contains a variety of climatic and geographic regions, is a place where Pokémon live relatively undisturbed by humans. Using a motorized, amphibious buggy named the Zero-One, Todd explores the island and takes photographs of the wide variety of Pokémon that inhabit its environments.

From Professor Oak's research hub, the player can select between the game's levels and features using a menu system. The path through the levels is linear, similar to a rail shooter. Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit to a course. After completing a course, the player selects their best picture of each Pokémon to be rated by Professor Oak and added to the Pokémon Report. Scoring takes into account various aspects of the pictures, such as the Pokémon's size, its pose, and keeping the Pokémon in frame. Extra points are awarded for capturing a "special" pose or Pokémon, such as a surfing Pikachu, and if there are multiples of the same Pokémon within the frame. Scoring well in the Pokémon Report and photographing a wide variety of Pokémon is required to make progress in the game.

The game features seven levels: Beach, Tunnel, Volcano, River, Cave, Valley, and the special course "Rainbow Cloud." However, the staggered acquisition of items from Professor Oak ensures that the player must re-explore the courses to discover new material. Levels must be replayed in order to locate hidden Pokémon, alternate routes, or photographic opportunities that yield the best scores. It also features a number of special items used to obtain better photographs. Players start out with an apple projectile; this is thrown to either stun Pokémon or attract Pokémon. As they progress, they obtain new items. Next, they gain an item called "Pester Balls", which are able to knock out Pokémon or flush them out of hiding. The Poké-Flute item is used for a variety of ways, such as awakening, irritating, or hatching Pokémon. It can cause Pokémon to dance, and it can play three different songs, resulting in different dances from certain Pokémon. The final item obtained is the Dash Engine, allowing players to go faster than normal. The game also features an "Album mark" where players can mark their favorite pictures to view at a later date or show to friends.



Development and release

Pokémon Snap was originally revealed as a Nintendo 64DD game.[1] It was developed by HAL Laboratory and Pax Softnica, and published by Nintendo. It was The game features 63 of the original generation of 151 Pokémon. It was released on March 21, 1999 in Japan, and June 30 and September 15 in North America and PAL regions, both in 1999. The Virtual Console re-release of Pokémon Snap, lacking the same hardware of the Nintendo 64, replaced it with the ability to save photos to players' Wiis and sharing them with friends. It was released on December 4, 10, and 11, all in 2007, in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively.

The title did not start development as a Pokémon product, but the developers felt it lacked a motivation for the players to take photos, which led to the idea of incorporating Pokémon

Description

At long last, all of your favorite Pokémon are rady to go head-to-head on the N64®! Whether you're battle a friend, a Gym Leader or a tournament contestant, you're about to witness some of the most spectacular battle scenes in Pokémon history! Select a team from a huge stable of "rental" battlers, or use the included N64 Transfer Pak™ to upload your own team from Pokémon Red, Blue or Yellow! This Stadium is packed and ready to rock!

Gameplay

Pokémon Stadium does not have a storyline. Progress in the game can only be made by winning "Cups" in the Stadium and completing the Gym Leader Castle. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle completed, Mewtwo will appear in the sky over the Stadium. Defeating Mewtwo will unlock Round 2, in which the player must re-challenge the Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and Mewtwo in order to complete the game.


Stadium

Pokémon tournaments take place in the Stadium. There are four Cups to participate in. Players choose a team of six Pokémon, in any combination of pregenerated rental Pokémon and Pokémon imported from a Game Boy cartridge. Each round consists of eight three-on-three battles, and the Poké and Prime Cups consist of four rounds, named after Poké Balls (Poké Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, Master Ball), that must be cleared to win that Cup.

    * Pika Cup: Battle using Pokémon from levels 15 to 20.
    * Petit Cup: Battle using Basic Pokémon from levels 25 to 30 who fall under a certain height and weight. The most restrictive Cup.
    * Poké Cup: Battle using Pokémon from levels 50 to 55.
    * Prime Cup: Battle using Pokémon of any level. All opponents' Pokémon are at level 100.



Gym Leader Castle

The player can challenge the eight Kanto Gym Leaders from the Game Boy games, as well as the Elite Four and the Champion (Rival). However, one must defeat three trainers before battling a Gym Leader. Each time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of eight randomly selected prize Pokémon will be awarded, which can be transferred to the player's Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow game using the Transfer Pak. The prize Pokémon are Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, Eevee, Kabuto, and Omanyte.



Versions


First (Japan only)

The original title, called Pokémon Stadium (?????????, Pokemon Sutajiamu?), was released in Japan on August 1, 1998. This version featured only 42 Pokémon available for battle, instead of the full 151 Pokémon from the Game Boy versions. The remaining Pokémon were viewable in a Pokédex, but the models lacked the required animations for battle. This version was not released outside of Japan, and as such the numbering of subsequent Japanese releases is ahead of the North America releases. This game was originally intended for the Nintendo 64DD format, but as the Nintendo 64DD was a commercial failure, Pokémon Stadium transferred to cartridge format. There was also a Pocket Monsters Stadium Expansion Disk proposed as an add-on for the Nintendo 64DD but was unreleased.

The first game had met widespread criticism for its difficulty, and in Pokémon Stadium 2 the AI was toned down to make it easier for average players to beat.

Second (first outside of Japan)

The second game was called Pokémon Stadium 2 (?????????2, Pokemon Sutajiamu Tsu?) in Japan and was released as Pokémon Stadium in North America. This version features all 151 original Pokémon from the original Game Boy games. The North American version of this game featured support for transferring Pokémon from Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow via the N64 Transfer Pak.

The North American version could also be purchased in a bundle that included the game with Transfer Pak, a Nintendo 64 with a gray controller, a second purple controller, the Pokémon Stadium Official Strategy Guide by Prima Games, and a "Cool Porygon" trading card.



Optional features

Pokémon Stadium has many features aside from the main battling sequence, such as mini-games and a Game Boy player on the Nintendo 64.

In Free Battle mode, players may conduct practice battles. Players can select rules from any of the tournament cups, or use modified rules. Up to four players may participate, using any combination of rental Pokémon and those imported from cartridges plugged into a Transfer Pak.

At the GB Tower, the player can play Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow on the Nintendo 64. Winning tournament cups in the Stadium will eventually unlock Doduo Mode (double speed) and Dodrio Mode (triple speed).

Victory Palace contains statues of Pokémon who have beaten the Elite Four in Gym Leader Castle or completed the highest round of a tournament in the Stadium.

Battle Now! is a battle arena for a quick battle with one or two players.

In an Event Battle, two players with Transfer Paks plugged in can use Pokémon from their Game Boy games and battle with custom rules.

Gallery is where you can snap photos of your Pokémon to be printed at a Pokémon Snap Station.

The Pokémon Lab is only accessible if a Game Boy cartridge is plugged into the Transfer Pak. If the game is saved in a Pokémon Center, the player may access the PC and can arrange boxed Pokémon and items. The Lab also features an interactive Pokédex and a machine for trading between two cartridges connected by Transfer Pak. Players cannot, however, transfer rental Pokémon from Pokémon Stadium. Certain Pokémon, such as Mew, could only be obtained at a Nintendo Promotional Event using a Transfer Pak; a rental Mew could be obtained in an event, but, as previously stated, cannot be transferred to Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow.

Kids Club is an area where nine Pokémon themed mini-games can be played, either as stand-alone games or as part of a tournament. One to four human players may participate, with the remaining players controlled by the computer. Many of the games utilize button mashing. A higher difficulty level could be obtained by beating the CPUs five times in a row on hard

Info

Pokémon Stadium 2, known as Pokémon Stadium Kin Gin (???????????, Pokemon Sutajiamu Kin Gin?, lit. "Pokémon Stadium Gold Silver") in Japan, is a video game for the Nintendo 64. It features all 251 Pokémon from the first and second generations. It was released in North America as simply Pokémon Stadium 2, as it was the second Stadium game to be released there. In Japan, Pokémon Stadium Kin Gin was the third game of the Pokémon Stadium series. The Japanese edition also featured the capability to use the Pokémon Mobile System from Pokémon Crystal which was also released on the same day.

This game featured support for all three original Game Boy Pokémon games (Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow) and the three Game Boy Color games (Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal). As in the previous Stadium games, Pikachu from Yellow was a hidden character if the game cartridge was connected. The majority of the game takes place inside the new location White City, where various facilities for battling, organizing, researching, and playing with Pokémon are located. This can be considered to be the Pokémon League for the second generation games. The sequel to the popular Pokémon Stadium features minigames, multiplayer, and league mode.

Story

Unlike the previous games where the storyline is rather comical, ~n has a serious storyline, reminiscent of those in the Madou Monogatari games.

Satan-sama is found looking at some books in a magical library when he comes across a black box. He begins to examine the black box before it breaks free from his hands and opens. The next morning a Puyo Circus has arrived, and Arle alongside Carbuncle go to check it out. They are greeted by a mysterious figure in Pierrot, a jester-looking character.

When Arle arrives, something doesn't appear right, and Carbuncle disappears once more. Arle has to navigate her way past a number of foes as before. During her quest Draco, Seriri, Witch and Chiko join up with Arle as they face Schezo and Rulue. Rulue knew something was up with Satansama, and as Arle met him, he appeared strange and unlike his normal self. He freezes the other characters so that they don't interfere. Arle beats Satansama, who wakes up and asks why Arle was there. Satansama explains to Arle that he was brainwashed by a stronger foe, and Pierrot appears afterwards, revealing herself to be Doppelganger Arle. The two have a fight to see who exists in the world, and Arle was victorious.

Another Dimension #1 Stage 15 - Satan

Another Dimension #2 Stage 16 - Doppelganger Arle


Gameplay

The gameplay of ~n remains similar to Puyo Puyo Tsu, with a new addition of character specials. As puyos are erased from the field, a power gauge fills up, and as it fills to the top, you can use a special. Each characters special ability differs from person to person, and these specials are very different between the domestic versions and the Game Boy Color version. Each grid in the domestic versions follows Rule Henka, where a preset field and special board rules are implemented. In the Game Boy Color version, whenever garbage was countered, Sun puyos would fall on the screens. This game also featured a few Tokoton modes where you could play on grids larger or smaller than 6x12 on the domestic versions, and featured a Free Battle mode where you could play against any of the other unlocked characters. The art is also vastly different to its predecessors, adopting a more serious tone compared to the other games.

Storyline

Satan has once again decided to create another test by using special magic to pull the Sun closer to the Earth on a remote island. This created a semi-resort, in which characters have decided to visit. Arle, together with Kaa-Kun, find the sun too hot, and see the building that Satan's emanating his own heat wave. Draco loves the hot weather and appears in a bikini, whereas Schezo, who takes refuge in a cave, finds that it's just not cool enough, and decides to find out what's happening.



Gameplay

Just like the predecessors, Puyos fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise by 90°. The rule of Sousai and Zenkesei still remained, but every time you countered, special garbage would fall on the screen in a preset pattern (in the Game Boy version of this game, it fell randomly). Every time you cleared the screen however, Sun Puyos would fall on the screen, and the All Clear bonus removed.
[edit] Sun Puyos

Sun Puyos are very similar to Point Puyos, in the sense that when erased with a neighbouring group, would send more garbage to the opponent. How much extra garbage would follow from a rensa was set up using the Fibonacci sequence, starting at 2 rather than 1, and then back-tracking.

The more Sun Puyos are erased, the more garbage is sent. This was considered a Rensa Bonus rather than a score bonus (as, unlike Point Puyos, they do not increase the score of the chain, just the amount of garbage sent).
Deciding Games

Like with the predecessor, if the third column from the left fills up to the top, the game is over.

Description

Heart-pounding gameplay, spectacular graphics and brain-shattering sound effects - guaranteed to have players jumping out of their skins! Incorporates the ferocity of the single-player game with the ultimate bloodlust of the two-player splitscreen Deathmatch. A true 3D polygonal environment that includes the most horrific creatures to grace a console. Startling dynamic lighting, levels designed by the masters, and an arsenal of the most awesome weaponry to match.


Midway brings Id's classic 3D shooter home to Nintendo 64 in good form. Don't miss the full review

Quake made its gaming debut for the PC two years ago. The dark 3D shooter was generally thought of as the "Doom killer"; sporting a polygon-pushing true 3D engine and options not found in Doom such as the ability to jump, look up-down and fight on multiple levels. But beyond everything else, Quake came to be known as one of, if not the very best multiplayer game ever created. Up to 16 (32 later) deathmatchers could battle it out over the Internet or local network, and new mission packs, hacks and upgrades were and still are a given.

And now Nintendo 64 owners finally get a chance to do some Quakin' of their own, courtesy of Midway Home Entertainment and the same development team responsible for Doom 64. But is it too little far too late? Quake 2 has been available for the PC for nearly six months, Goldeneye has raised the standards of the first-person shooter for Nintendo 64 and the hype for Turok 2 is just beginning. The 64-bit update of Id's classic shooter has quite a bit to live up to.

The Facts

Quake (Nintendo 64)

    * Resolution: 320x240
    * Bi-Linear Filtering, Anti-aliaising
    * Consistently high frame rate
    * Ambient sound effects very similar to Doom 64. No music.
    * A total of 25 single-player levels and seven deathmatch levels. No exclusive N64 levels. No Co-op mode
    * Deathmatches are split-screen for two players. Frame rate suffers slightly in two-player mode.
    * Fake colored-lighting via prerendered light-maps and no real-time light-sourcing. Rockets won't illuminate hallways as they go, the nailgun won't light up a room, etc. Everything has been pre-colored.
    * Rumble Pak support
    * Controls can be customized. There are six built-in configurations, including a scheme identical to Turok and another identical to Goldeneye. 

Gameplay
If you've ever sat down with the PC version of Quake then you probably won't be shocked with the changes made (or lack thereof) for the Nintendo 64 port of the game. All of the levels from the PC are back (with no Nintendo 64 exclusives) in slightly modified form; a few objects moved around here and there with monsters repositioned occasionally as well. Don't expect exclusive, brand new levels.

For that one person out there who has never played or heard of Quake before, the object of the game is to make it through alive, while killing as many enemy soldiers and mutations as humanly possible. Of course, there's a simplistic story mixed in for good measure, but you'll never notice it (or remember it) once the carnage begins -- which is immediately.

Players must battle through 25 levels, acquiring keys to unlock doors to progress through the game. A massive army of soldiers, sorcerers and demons await at every turn. Quakers aren't exactly harmless though; weapons such as the nailgun, super nailgun, shotgun, missile launcher, grenade launcher, lightning gun and axe make up the wide arsenal of destruction available.

Whereas Goldeneye requires brains and technique, Quake requires quick thinking and lots of bullets. There are no objectives here, except to kill everything in sight and make it to the next level. It's bloody good fun at a frantic pace -- and we do mean bloody. Body parts explode into pieces upon being hit by a rocket, decapitated heads roll to a dead stop, and satanic overtones are everywhere. The Nintendo 64 version retains all of the violent goodness in its pure form.

The analog stick is put to good use, delivering precise control (comparable to the PC mouse) for navigating or, if Turok-style is your thing, for aiming. It should be noted though, that turns can't be performed as fast as a sensitive mouse setup, where a complete revolution can be performed in a split second. Still, Quake responds better and moves much quicker than both Turok and Goldeneye, as it should.

Graphics
The game is running in a lower resolution than GL Quake and also seems to be using less detailed environments, probably to keep the frame rate high. Where as certain surroundings in PC Quake have grooves, markings, added design and more depth, the Nintendo 64 version looks a little naked in comparison. However, the difference, while noticeable, is not annoying and in fact the 64-bit version does look better than the unaccelerated version of Quake for PC. Like the PC version, there is no real-time environmental light-sourcing, which is disappointing considering that Lobotomy Software managed to add the feature for the Saturn version and it looks great. On the other hand, the colored-lighting present in Quake 64 gives the illusion of illuminated areas, colored rooms and so on. And we're not going to downplay this addition to the game because it really adds atmosphere. Hallways illuminate red, yellow, green, blue and orange; rooms glow with color and all of this happens with no hit on framerates, which run smoothly at all times.

Sound
Many will disagree, but we like the ambient sound effects in Quake 64 better than Trent Reznor's soundtrack for the PC version. The grunts, whispers, sadistic howls and everything else blend together nicely for a dark, urgent mood that while also present in Reznor's soundtrack, isn't as effective. Nintendo 64's Quake represents one of those rare cases where music simply isn't needed; the dark sound effects do much more for the frantic feeling of the game.

Multiplayer
Midway delayed Quake so that the development team would have time to implement a multiplayer mode for the game. Well, it's in there, but unfortunately the feature isn't all that it could be. Quake offers two-player split-screen deathmatches, whereas the competition (namely Goldeneye) has four. There are no cooperative modes. Framerates suffer (sometimes drastically -- lots of explosions on-screen at once) during the multiplayer mode and there are only a handful of levels that can be played (seven in all). And finally, if you've ever played the PC version of Quake you're probably going to gawk at the multiplayer options in comparison.

On the other hand, the two-player deathmatches are playable and can be extremely fun, especially when explosions aren't interfering with smooth framerates. Quake generally moves much faster than other first-person shooters and usually whoever shoots first kills first.
Closing Comments
The Nintendo 64 version of Quake is exceptionally well done, but it's still the same game. There are no new levels, no new monsters or weapons and the multiplayer mode pales in comparison to its PC predecessor. Visually, it looks better than the original PC version, but not quite as good as the 3DFX accelerated upgrade. Pre-rendered colored textures give the game its own moody look and the framerate is very high most of the time.

Despite its flaws, Nintendo 64 owners looking for the Quake experience can't go wrong with this game -- if for single-player mode alone. However, seasoned Quakers looking for the ultimate multiplayer game may want to rent before they buy.
Another Take

from Peer Schneider
I agree with Matt's rating. The N64 conversion of Quake is a recommended buy for action fans, despite its disappointing shortcomings in the multiplayer department and the lack of improvements over the original (the animation and weapon effects are rather dated). Compared to the best of the genre, GoldenEye, Quake delivers faster action and (perhaps because of its ambient music) a surprisingly scary atmosphere. If you own any other version of Quake, skip this one. If not, prepare yourself for some major fragging.

A little tip: Switch off the filtering effects in the Video menu to get rid of the blur.

Description

Celtland has been cast into chaos by the theft of Eletale's Book. This mystical volume contains the secrets of the Spirit Tamers. Control Brian, a magician's apprentice, as he explores the expansive countryside and villages on his quest. If he does not reclaim the book, the Kingdom of Celtland will be cast into darkness forever.


Story

The playable character is an apprentice mage named Brian. Brian sets off to find his father who has left the monastery of the magesï¿½the player learns later that his father is looking for a thief who has stolen the "Eletale Book". The player must also collect elemental amulets, which have been hoarded by powerful criminals and are integral in the defeat of the game's final boss.

Characters

The game's main characters and bosses are:

Brian ï¿½ A young boy who has set out to save his father. He lives at Melrode Monastery, and is an apprentice magician with the ability to use Water, Fire, Wind, and Earth magic. The protagonist's name in the Japanese version is Jean-Jacques (ã‚¸ãƒ£ãƒ³ã‚¸ãƒ£ãƒƒã‚¯?), while he is called Ayron in PAL region releases

Lord Bartholomy ï¿½ Brian's father and Master Spirit Tamer. He lives at Melrode Monastery and set out to get the Eletale Book which was stolen, but was subdued at Brannoch Castle before being able to continue.

Leonardo ï¿½ Another apprentice magician like Brian who appears at Normoon and at Brannoch Castle near the end of the game. Though not a "main" character, he still manages to help Brian by providing healing items in a room within Brannoch Castle.

Leila ï¿½ The guardian of Larapool, the city of water. She has the ability to control the water flow of the city, thus giving Brian access to Larapool's entrance to Blue Cave.

Colleen ï¿½ A Sorceress who has protected the Water Jewel for generations is the only inhabitant of the Isle of Skye; her home is connected to Epona's home.

Epona ï¿½ The mysterious seer who resides in the Blue Cave; her connection to the Isle of Skye gives Brian access to the Water Jewel. Later on, her powers allow her to enter Mammon's Dimension at the end of the game to provide aid to Brian.

King Scottfort ï¿½ King of Kenneshire, rules over Dondoran Castle in Dondoran.

Queen Deanna ï¿½ Queen of Carmagh, rules over Limelin Castle in Limelin and rules alone due to the death of her husband.

Prince William ï¿½ The son of Queen Deanna and the crowned prince of Limelin.

King Beigis ï¿½ Militant and power-hungry king of Highland, rules over Brannoch Castle in Brannoch Castle Town.

Fargo ï¿½ Arsonist and thief who stole the Fire Ruby.

Nepty ï¿½ Magician and thief who stole the Water Crystal.

Zelse ï¿½ Magician in a group of vagabonds in Normoon and thief who stole the Wind Jade.

Solvaring ï¿½ Self-proclaimed "King of the Beasts" and thief who stole the Earth Orb from the King of Dondoran.

Mammon ï¿½ The demonic embodiment of greed who attempts to trick Brian into releasing him from his prison so that he may seek to possess the powers of the human spirit.

Shilf ï¿½ Mammon's assistant, hiding in Baragoon Tunnel.

Shannon ï¿½ A puppet created by Mammon for the sole purpose of leading Brian around the world to collect the Elemental Gems, and who, near the end of the game, threatens to kill Brian's father, Bartholomy, unless Brian kills King Beigis and opens the World of Mammon.

Guilty ï¿½ King Beigis' monstrous looking apprentice. He has made Brannoch Castle Town a living mess with his magic experiments.
Setting

The game's story takes place in a typical medieval fantasy world. It bears incredible resemblance to Ireland.


Gameplay

The game differs from most other RPGs in that the experience system is not based upon a traditional "level-up" model. Instead, experience is gained for specific stats based on how the player performs in battle. If the character gets hit a lot, for instance, defense will increase. Also, whenever the player finds a wispy white spirit, they can choose an element of magic to upgrade (from Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind). Leveling up these elements grants the character new attacks and strengthens existing ones.

The game has no money system. Every item is either found in a treasure chest, given to the player character free of charge, or dropped by a monster, if the character doesn't have one already. If the character runs out of HP, the game will return him to the last inn at which he saved. He will be allowed to retain all spells, items, and experience he has gained before death, but he may decline to do so by resetting the game without saving, and in any case, any items used before death will not be returned.


Development

The game was first previewed at Space World in 1997 under the working title Eltale (ã‚¨ãƒ«ãƒ†ã‚¤ãƒ«) as its name.

Because North American and PAL releases of the game were considered too short and too easy, Imagineer added new events and tightened some of the repetitive gameplay for the game's Japanese localization

Racing Simulation 2
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Racing
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Ubisoft
Publisher: UbiSoft
Players: Single player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Description

Innovative 4-point physics engine calculates and monitors all 4 tires independently, creating the most precise simulation of Grand Prix style racing you will ever experience. 16 international courses, and all tracks to scale with realistic dimensions, scenery and environments. Up to 22 racers competing on each track. Arcade, Amateur, Expert and Pro modes. Indestructible cars or real-life damage, dents and shrapnel. Weather effects and multiple road conditions. Start as an inexperienced driver with an entry-level team. As your skill improves, you're invited to race for more prestigious teams.

Monaco Grand Prix known in Europe as Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2 is a Formula one racing game for the Nintendo 64, Sony Playstation, and Sega Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars etc. (The licence was held by Video System at the time who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II.) The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others[citation needed]. This helps to add to the authenticity of the game.

The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1997 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which you start with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor to create your own tracks.
[edit] Trivia

    * Ubisoft did not have the official FIA license. Therefore they licensed only the Monaco track and named the game after it. All other F1 tracks are also included, but using different names.
    * In the United Kingdom the title is 'Racing Simulation: Monaco Grand Prix'
    * In Germany the game is just know as 'Racing Simulation 2' and has a different cover.

Rakuga Kids
Platform: Nintendo 64
Genre: Beat 'em Up
Release Year: 1998
Developer: KCEK
Publisher: Konami
Players: Single player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Rakuga Kids (??????, Rakugakizzu?, Rakugakids) is a 2.5D fighting game created by Konami for the Nintendo 64, released in 1998. The name Rakugakids is a portmanteau of the Japanese word rakugaki (a doodle), and kids, a reflection of the visual style of the game which resembled children's drawings.


Basics

The game is similar in play to a toned-down Marvel vs. Capcom. The button layout is the fighting game standard six-buttons (Three punches and three kicks.), which produce special moves when combined with various directional commands.

All characters have a single-button attack that sends the opponent into the air, where they can pursue them and follow up with an aerial attack. Perhaps to complement this, each character can perform an additional jump while in the air.

Magic

Super Combos in this game are referred to as "Magic" and a player can have up to three levels of Magic (Represented by three crayons that appear at the bottom of the screen.). Super Meter levels can be spent in three ways: Offense (An attack that causes heavy damage with a few hits.), Defense (An attack that causes little damage, but sends the opponent far away.) and Counter (Usable only while the character is blocking, causes medium damage and sends the opponent flying away, like Defense Magic.)



Characters

    * Astronots: A Buck Rogers-like astronaut and the game's protagonist. He fights using assorted pulp-era sci-fi devices like a raygun and rocket boots. He is like the typical Ryu of the game.
    * Captain. Cat. Kit: An anthropomorphic cat dressed like a stereotypical rapper. Fights using brass instruments, a basketball and breakdancing moves. Also has the ability to spontaneously combust at will.
    * Marsa A witch bearing a hat that acts like a chicken. Marsa is the only one who can triple jump, and her 'Marsa Jump' sends her far up off screen. Used strategically, you can avoid danger with it.
    * Robot C.H.O: The game's heavyweight grappler character. A robot who can transform into various metal objects, like a trashcan or a car. Interestingly, the spinning letters on its hand and head will change depending on its actions.
    * Beartank: A green bear with tank guns on its head and back. It can change its body into a set of tank treads (Leaving only its head exposed.) and fire small copies of itself from either gun. For some reason, it is constantly sleeping. It is the speediest character, the second being Captain. Cat. Kit.
    * Cools. Roy A cowboy-like character, who fights with honor (his taunt is a bow to the opponent). He is a palette-swap of Astronots.
    * Mamezo: a yellow Cartoon-villain with a green cape. His moves are mostly Jelli-like Transformations in various gadgets and tools (like a fork, an iron, a scissor and more) or summon rockets and other things. He was supposed to be the main villain in the intro.

Hidden Characters

    * Inuzo: The game's sub-boss character. A palette-swap of Mamezo with identical moves.
    * Darkness: The game's boss character.


Trivia

    * In Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, Nathan (The game's protagonist) can transform into the Beartank character by equipping the Bear Ring and activating the Black Dog and Pluto cards (Which normally transforms him into a Skeleton).
    * Beartank also appears as a secret character in Konami Krazy Racers.
    * Music from the game also appears in some of Konami's Bemani games, namely Beatmania GB and Pop n' Music.

Rampage - World Tour
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Action
Release Year: 1998
Developer: Saffire
Publisher: Midway Games
Players: Single player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Description

A wild smash-'em-up romp with universal appeal! Simple enough for any player. Plenty of depth and challenge to appeal to serious gamers as well. Bring a friend or two on a non-stop RAMPAGE while you inflict some major damage and destruction. Demolish buildings, swat down aircraft, eat people and rack up points, while destroying entire cities! More than 130 standard levels, 14 bonus levels, 4 grudge match levels and many hidden levels! Special bosses and some tasty humans give Lizzy, George or Ralph a major health boost.

Plot

George, Lizzie, and Ralph have been released due to an explosion at a Scumlabs facility. The trio begin to destroy all of Scumlabs' bases scattered throughout the world and kill its employees. In the last levels, Scumlabs CEO Eustace DeMonic turns himself into a monster in an attempt to combat George, Lizzie, and Ralph, but is defeated during a battle on a lunar base. After this, the only surviving Scumlabs employee, Dr. Betty Veronica, tries to kill the monster with a ray gun on her spaceship, but this only shrinks them and they wind up inside her ship.

Gameplay

Like in the first Rampage game, the goal of every stage is to destroy all the buildings in each city while avoiding or destroying the military forces. If the player takes too long in destroying the city, jets will fly in and bomb the remaining buildings, ending the stage with a lower score.

In this game, the player has some control over the course of the game. In the first level, Peoria, a tourism billboard cycles through different regions in the country (Northeast, Southwest, etc.). Destroying the billboard when it is showing one of these regions will send the player in that direction. Players may also choose to eat or ignore the "World Tour" powerups and control which country they can visit. After getting a World Tour power-up, the next few levels will take place in a foreign location until a Scumlabs plant is destroyed. The game will not end until every Scumlabs city has been destroyed, which may cause some erratic traveling around towards the end of the game (including multiple world tour trips if the players have missed or purposely kept from getting world tour flags).

A humorous effect is taken if your monster eats some specific civilians, such as eating people garbed in church clothes will cause lightning to strike your monster. If your monster eats a toxic waste canister at a Scumlabs facility, the monster will turn into a superpowerful flying monster named V.E.R.N. (Violent Enraged Radioactive Nemesis), which will last until the level ends. He also appears in the Wii version of Rampage: Total Destruction.



Info

Rampage World Tour is a video game released in 1997 and is the second game in the Rampage series.

Up to three simultaneous players control the monsters George (a King Kong-like gorilla), Lizzy (a Godzilla-like dinosaur), or Ralph (a giant werewolf), created from humans who were mutated by experiments conducted at Scumlabs. They need to destroy all buildings in a high-rise city to advance to the next city. On their way they can destroy helicopters, tanks, taxis, police cars, boats, and trolleys, as well as eat people.

The monsters can jump and climb buildings, and attack enemies and buildings with punches. Some buildings also take damage when jumped on.

The player receives damage from enemy bullets, grenades, shells, etc., or from falls. Damage can be recovered by eating the right food, such as fruit, roast chicken, or soldiers. If a monster takes too much damage, it reverts back into a naked human and starts walking off the screen sideways covering themselves with their hands. If the player continues, the human will mutate back into the monster with a full life bar.

The game was developed as an arcade game for Midway by Game Refuge Inc. designers Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman, who conceived and designed the original back in 1986. It was then ported to the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and as a download on the PlayStation 3's Playstation Network. It has also been re-released on Midway Arcade Treasures 2 as well as being an unlockable in Rampage: Total Destruction.


List of cities in which Rampage World Tour takes place

Note: This order of this list is based on one possible route. The cities may appear in a different order depending on which direction you choose to go at the start of the game. Also, the international missions appear randomly any time you find and hit a "World Tour" icon.

You'll meet Ruby the Lobster, Boris the Rhino, and Curtis the Rat as they destroy cities in North America, Asia, and Europe!

Story

George, Lizzie, and Ralph have been captured for the world to see. George is held at New York, Lizzie is imprisoned in Tokyo, and Ralph is stored in London (references to King Kong, Godzilla, and The Werewolf of London, respectively). Scumlabs, who has just rebuilt their facilities in Salt Lake City, causes another accident that results in three new monsters: Curtis, a mouse, Boris, a rhinoceros, and Ruby, a lobster. Players choose one of the three original monsters to rescue. The player then uses the characters in the part of the world where the rescue is held. They work as a collective to break buildings, eat people, and destroy cars and this creates competition among players. When a player (literally) unlocks Ralph, Lizzie, or George, then they become playable characters. Once all the monsters are rescued, aliens begin to invade the earth, leaving the monsters the only ones who can save the planet they just helped partially destroy. After fending off the invasion on Earth, the monsters rescue Myukus (a cyclops-like alien) from Area 51 before chasing the aliens through space, destroying the aliens' bases throughout the Solar System and eventually rampaging through their homeworld.

Rat Attack!
Platform: Nintendo 64
Genre: Puzzle
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Pure Entertainment
Publisher: Mindscape
Players: Single player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Rat Attack
_________________________
*
Description

RAT ATTACK! Nuke 'em! The mutant rat invasion is on! And the little rodents have a freakish plot: create bazillions of bizarre and deadly rats bent on trashing everything they can sink their teeth into! YOU gotta stop 'em! Become one of the SCRATCH CATS, an elite squad of eight cat commandos dedicated to protecting the world from its biggest threat yet! Over 50 action-packed levels, 15 specifically designed for multi-player. Six Scratch Cat characters to choose from, plus two hidden "super" cats! 


Story

The Cat Genius Professor Rex Julius presented his theories to the public of the threat that the ever expanding rat population would bring chaos to the world. However, his workings were laughed at by his colleagues, ignoring his research. He was so certain of his fears, however, that he continued to work in secret, developing the eraticator, a rat capturing device, and the destructor, where rats in the eraticator's storage tanks can finally be destroyed (through vaporisation). He also formed and trained an elite team of rat-catching cats, the Scratch Cats.

Soon, Rex's greatest fears were to be realised. A pair of rats, Washington and Jefferson were sent into space aboard a rocket in an experiment. However, after some incident in space, the rats had been mutated and gained super-intelligence. Over 40 years have passed, They returned to earth and immediately commenced with plans for world domination, amassing a huge army of rats with instructions to destroy everything in sight and to destroy any interfering agents. To this end they created the duplicator, to rapidly increase their army. For extra protection and assistance the pair created easily mutatable genetic blueprint rats, and created the mutator, capable of transforming these into a range of vicious mutant rats.

Washington and Jefferson also made plans to re-awaken the mighty King Scarab, captor of the mythical cat, Banubis, from his slumber in the Egyption wing of a museum.

Professor Rex Julius sent his special agent Pearl to investigate, but Washington and Jefferson managed to capture her, imprisoning her within a laser cage in their factory stronghold, guarded by giant robotic dogs. This spurred the other cats into action, so they went out to rescue Pearl and defeat Washington and Jefferson, and free Banubis from King Scarab's clutches along the way.

At the end of the game, with all the areas saved from the ravaging rat army, the Scratch Cats manage to defeat Washington and Jefferson in a showdown in their space base. However, the duo manage to escape after their defeat, Julius afterwards revealing that they also took King Scarab with them (who had been shrunk after his defeat; it is unknown whether he has returned to full size or not).

 Gameplay

The object of the game was to clear each level of a certain total of rats, without getting hit enough times to lose a life, or ensuring the room wasn't destroyed, which would also kill you. Each level had a set number of rats to destroy, and once you had met the target, a gate would appear that you had to go through to get to the next level. If you didn't get to it in ten seconds, you'll lost a life. Rats are destroyed by eraticating them (basically trapping them within a circle.) Once the rats were trapped within the tanks, walking over a pad on the floor with a rats face on it (a destructor) would destroy them. At the end of each level you will receive bonuses reflecting how well you had done. You received "Damage Bonuses" for how much the room got damaged (the less damage, the higher points), time bonuses (the less time taken, the higher the bonus), and perfect bonuses (if none of the room got destroyed, you obtained these points.)

Rayman 2 - The Great Escape
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Platformer
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Ubisoft Montpellier
Publisher: Ubisoft
Players: 1
_________________________
*
Description

Enter a massive 3-D action adventure of amazing beauty and challenge. The pirate terror has enslaved the world and only Rayman's speed, agility, and magical powers can save all. Race and battle across 45 intricately designed areas - rainforests, jungles, narrow canyon passes, even into the mighty pirate ship itself.


Gameplay

In contrast to its predecessor, which was a traditional 2D Platformer, Rayman 2 is a 3D game, though it is still in most aspects a platform game. The player navigates through a mostly linear sequence of levels, fighting enemy Robo-Pirates, solving puzzles and collecting lums. Collecting enough lums gains the player access to new parts of the world[12]. Part of the lums are hidden in small cages, in which other freedom fighters or Teensies are imprisoned, and can be obtained by breaking the cages.

In addition to the main, story-based level sequence, there are also several levels in which the player can gain bonuses in a time trial. Though these levels have no connection to the story, they are visually similar to the rest of the game and feature several characters and items also found in the "normal" levels. Additionally, by collecting all lums and breaking all cages in a level, the player unlocks a bonus level in which one of Globox's children races against a robot pirate. When the player controlling the child wins the race, Rayman gains full health.

The main weapon available in the game is Rayman's fist, with which energy orbs can be shot. The orbs can be charged before shooting them, making them more powerful. At some points powder kegs are found, which can be carried and thrown at enemies or structures to destroy them. At various points throughout the game a big, purple plum can be obtained which can be used to immobilize certain enemies, and to ride on surfaces which can otherwise not be touched by Rayman. When riding a plum, the normal controls are not available and the player needs to give Rayman direction by shooting in the opposite direction of the one he wants to go to.

In addition to the plum, the player can also ride robot shells which need to be tamed first, after which they will allow the player to sit on their back and indicate the direction. During such sequences the player can not shoot. In some levels, Rayman gains the ability to fly; in one level by use of his helicopter hair, in another by holding on to a flying gunpowder barrel.




Setting

The game centers on the invasion of the world where the game takes place (the Glade of Dreams[8]) by robot pirates from outer space. In order to repair the damage to the world and defeat the invasion force, Rayman has to collect 1000 pieces (800 in the PS1 version) of the world's core (called Lums) and reunite four magical masks which will awaken Polokus, the world's spirit. Polokus has gone into hiding a long time ago, however as he is the creator of "all that is and will be", he is the world's last hope.

 Plot

Rayman 2 takes place in a world called The Glade of Dreams. An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core. This greatly weakens the resistance's power and disables Rayman's powers, leading to his capture.

Globox, a friend of Rayman, is later also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the Pirates' prison ship. Globox restores one of his powers through a silver lum given to him by Ly, a fairy. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that in order to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find 4 ancient, magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world[10]. He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies[10].

In the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir.

Eventually Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes. Rayman is presumed dead and only one of his shoes is found, but during his funeral he appears again, walking on a crutch.
Screenshot of the Fairy Glade, the second level of the game
[edit] Narrative

The game is played from a third person perspective and the player has control over the camera, though in some situations this control is limited to only certain angles. At several points in the game the player loses control during cut scenes, which typically show dialogue between characters. The gameplay is also interrupted by a cut scene taking place in Admiral Razorbeards room aboard the prison ship several times. During these scenes, Rayman is not present.

By collecting lums, the player unlocks more information about the game world and its backstory, which can be read by standing still and pressing a specific button for some time. Some back story is also obtained through (optional) instructions from Murfy, a "flying encyclopedia[11]" who provides explanations on all kinds of gameplay elements.

Description

Radio control racing done right! Rip it up with realistic physics, power-packed weapons and interactive environments! Blast through traffic with bottle rockets, water balloons and oil slicks! Four-player racing madness! Stunt Track, Battle Tag and four different racing modes. Barrel through museums, trash toy stores or design your own track with our custom editor! True R/C physics! Objects and surfaces affect the action just like real life.


Gameplay

The game featured 28 stock cars and 14 tracks including a stunt arena for free roaming. Cars come in three fuel variants; electric, glow (internal combustion) and special. The players driving ability will place them into various categories so that they race against other cars of similar capabilities. These capabilities are classified in categories which are: Rookie, Amateur, Advanced, Semi-Pro and Pro. Tracks are also categorized depending on their difficulty to master and win. These categories are: Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme. Cars and tracks are both unlocked through success in the game's tournament modes.

Single Race allows 2-4 players on the Console Versions and 2-12 players on the PC Version to race on the normal, single-player tracks. Within each race, competitors race to be the first to complete a pre-set number of laps of the circuit. To aid them in this there are a variety of lightning-bolt shaped pick-ups lying around the track. Collecting one of these provides the player with a random weapon varying from oil slicks to fireworks to batteries that increase your speed for a short period of time. The worse a player is doing in the race, the more likely one of the better weapons will be obtained, and vice versa.



Legacy

Although Acclaim Entertainment is now defunct, fans support the game by producing fan-made vehicles and courses, and by operating multi-player servers. Fans have also created a Windows-based chat/lobby client called "RV House" that allows players to connect and play together. While new players may experience a significant learning curve, the community remains active with records of fastest laps and new courses and cars still being added. The community has recently acquired the source code of the game and a new Re-Volt version 1.2 is currently in developmen

Description

Let's Get Ready To Rumble. 16 fighters who are ready to get down and get it on. An arsenal of taunts and verbal assaults. In-game announcements by Michael Buffer. Low blows, lunging hooks, overhead punches and more. Hidden combo moves for crushing punishment. Rumble power unleashes extreme moves. Arcade, championship and training modes. Create and save your ideal boxer.



Info

Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo 64 and it was released in 1999 by Midway. The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.

The game is reminiscent of Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series in that it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris "The Bear" Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.

Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word "RUMBLE" is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called "Rumble Flurry", which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.

One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game.[1]

The Game Boy Color version was one of very few GBC games to feature built-in rumble.

The Dreamcast, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions each have a fighter unique to them: these are, respectively, Jimmy Blood, Gino Stiletto and J.R. Flurry.

The game was followed by a sequel in 2000 called Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2, and was later followed by a third game in the series, Ready 2 Rumble: Revolution, released on March 17, 2009.[2]

Afro Thunder features in TNA Impact! upon gaining 750,000 Style Points.

Description

The King of the Ring is back! 17 boxers: Afro Thunder and company return with 13 all-new characters including four special celebrity characters! New rumble modes: Save up your power for a Knock-Em-Out-of-the-Ring Punch! Party modes: New Tournament and Team Battle modes for head-to-head competition for you and all your friends. New mini-games: Increase your speed, strength and agility by training with rumble pads, jump rope, speed bag and more. Improved single-player AI: Smarter, harder, and faster!


Gameplay

Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits you land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below your player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.

Resident Evil 2

Ready or not, the terror of Resident Evil 2 is here. In chapter one, the case of the disastrous T-virus outbreak--a mutagenic toxin designed for biological weapons--was eventually closed but the experiments were far from over. Control the destiny of Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield as their nightmare begins when a biotech terror runs rampant in Raccoon City. Relentless zombies and hideous monsters are all out for a taste of your blood. If the suspense doesn't kill you, something else will.


Gameplay

Resident Evil 2 follows the same basic gameplay mechanics as its predecessor.[1] The graphics are composed of polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds using fixed camera angles.[1][2] A survival horror title, the game's objective is to explore different locations while solving puzzles and fighting numerous monsters.[1] The two selectable protagonists may be equipped with a variety of firearms, though ammunition is limited, adding a tactical element to weapon use.[1][3] On the status screen, the player can check the condition of the characters, use medicine to heal wounds inflicted upon them in battle, and assign weapons.[4][5] Additionally, the current health of the protagonists can be determined by their animation and the speed of their movement.[1] For example, wounded characters will hold their stomach in pain, whereas they will limp slowly when they are on the verge of death.[1] The protagonists can only carry a certain amount of items at a time, requiring the rest to be stored in and retrieved from boxes scattered across the locations.[1][6] The game may be saved at some select rooms with a typewriter, though one-time-use ink ribbons are necessary to do so.


The main addition to the gameplay is the "Zapping System":[9] Each of the two playable characters is confronted with different puzzles and storylines in their respective scenario.[1] After finishing the "A" scenario with one protagonist, a "B" scenario is unlocked in which the events are depicted from the other character's perspective.[10][1] Actions taken during the first playthrough affect the second scenario, for example in the availability of certain items.[1] After each game, the player receives a ranking based on the total time taken to complete the scenario, and the number of saves and first aid sprays used.[11] Depending on certain requirements, bonus weapons and costumes are unlocked as a reward.[10] Additional minigames are available in the form of "The 4th Survivor", "The To-fu Survivor" and "Extreme Battle", three standalone missions featuring an extended cast of characters



Plot

The game is set in the Midwestern mountain community of Raccoon City,[13] two months after the mansion incident of the first Resident Evil.[14] Nearly all of the citizens have been turned into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella.[15][16] Having just arrived in the city, Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris, make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population.[15] There, they find out that most of the policemen have been killed already[17] and that Chris has left the town some time ago to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe.[18] With no more motivation to stay, the two protagonists decide to split up to look for other survivors, and to flee from the city.[19][20]

In search of an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.[19][21] Claire discovers that Umbrella bribed Raccoon City's police chief Brian Irons to cover up any evidence of the mansion incident for the purpose of masking the development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of turning a human into the ultimate bioweapon.[19][22] The maniacal Irons is killed by one such G-virus mutant roaming the police department while Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and are separated from each other.[19] Splitting up from Leon, Ada runs into Sherry and picks up the golden pendant she lost.[19] Further into the sewers, a middle-aged woman fires at Ada, but Leon dives in front of her and takes a shot himself.[19] Ada follows the assassin who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette, and the wife of William Birkin, the creator of the G-virus.[19] In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry.[19] Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant, and a battle over it ensues during which she is thrown over a railing.[23] Ada finds out that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.[15][19]

Meanwhile, Claire reunites with Sherry and discovers that Birkin has already implanted her with an embryo to produce offspring.[19] The protagonists advance through an abandoned factory to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. Ada is heavily wounded by an attack from Birkin, and Leon explores the laboratory to find something to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette explaining to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a smokescreen to get information about Umbrella, and that she is really a spy sent by an unknown organization to retrieve the G-virus. Just as she is about to shoot Leon, a Tyrant appears and she is forced to retreat. Ada shows up again and sacrifices herself to rescue Leon, confessing that she fell in love with him.[19] Trying to escape with another sample of the G-virus, Annette is fatally wounded by her mutated husband, but manages to give Claire instructions on how to produce a vaccine for Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, saving her life. Birkin, now mutated into a massive blob, followed them but is eventually destroyed when the self-destruct system causes the train to explode. Ada is implied to have survived and to have made away with the G-virus in the pendant. Having escaped from the city with Sherry, Leon decides to take down Umbrella while Claire continues to search for her brother.


The minigame "The 4th Survivor" depicts the successful G-virus retrieval mission of Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella,[25] whereas "The To-fu Survivor" and "Extreme Battle" are completely independent missions that bear no relevance to the plot of the game

Road Rash 64
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Racing > Motorcycles
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Pacific Coast Power & Light
Publisher: THQ
_________________________

Description

180 MPH slap in the face, anyone? Multi-player modes for up to four players including Deathmatch, Cop Mode and Tag. New weapons and moves like the dreaded spoke jam. Intense pack brawling, including grudges and alliances. 200 miles of interconnected tracks and environments. Over 25 bikes and characters to choose from. Thrashin' soundtrack featuring Sugar Ray, The Mermen and more!

Road Rash 64 for the Nintendo 64 was released in 1999. It is noteworthy because Electronic Arts did not design or publish it. Instead, the intellectual property rights were licensed to THQ, who in turn had its own studio, Pacific Coast Power & Light (founded by former EA employee Don Traeger), develop the game.

Road Rash 64 was also designed similarly to F-Zero X in that the game used very low polygon models, low resolution textures, and few special effects so that the game could instead feature several dozen motorcycles, traffic models, and obstacles while being able to keep a high frame rate. The game was more focused on the combat aspects the earlier 16-bit games featured, and was ahead of its time in terms of customizable settings in a console game. N64 owners with a Ram Expansion Pak were able to choose from Wide Screen, Letterbox, and High Resolution settings in addition to the default graphics setting. The game also managed to feature five of the tracks from Road Rash 3D through audio compression software.

Unlike the games before it, which used a single long road in independent locales, Road Rash 64's races took place on routes laid out through a single interconnected road system. The race routes were pieced together from branching road segments. The four corners of the game world had distinctly different geographic features. Once past the first level the races would be between or through different locales.

Robotech: Crystal Dreams
Platform: Nintendo 64
Genre: Simulation > Flight
Developer: GameTek
Publisher: N/A
Players: Single player, multiplayer
_________________________
*
Robotech: Crystal Dreams was a canceled Robotech video game for the Nintendo 64. The developer, GameTek filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before the game could be completed, and was subsequently liquidated. The game was announced on May 1995 as one of the first titles going to be released at the launch of the Nintendo 64 under the working title, Robotech Academy but was eventually cancelled days after being shown at the 1998 E³ trade show. Antarctic Press produced a promotional comic book that was handed out at E³ and is now considered a collectors item.
[edit] Game Play

Crystal Dreams was primarily a space fighter simulation game, but between levels the player would return to base and be able to interact with a variety of other characters, the game also had a continuing war time line that the player could get reports of what was happening in various parts of space, and could help out by rushing to the aid of those that needed their help most.[1]
[edit] Background

The game was originally conceived as an ambitious title that involved rendering everything using models in real dimensions, with no background sprites making up the scenery. Planets and stars were all rendered in 3D and in perspective; this resulted in the entire rendered universe requiring six months of real time to traverse from one end to the other. The game was also going to include over 40 minutes of dialogue and featured open-ended gameplay, allowing the player to pick up missions and help the various organizations at his own discretion.

Since work began on Crystal Dreams well before Nintendo finalised their console's hardware, Gametek were unsure on the amount of processing power the system would have and wanted to ensure they could have fast gameplay while having many enemies on screen at the same time. To ensure this, the team used very simple crystal models for the enemies and created a story based around them. Ultimately the low-resolution models were unnecessary, but the design and story had already been established.

The resources and money required to produce a quality 3D title during this transitional period from 2D to 3D was not well understood and the project fell behind schedule. The game's original publisher pulled out, GameTek were unable to find another and did not have the capital to fund the project alone. The developers concede that their design was probably too ambitious, particularly from such a small company; Gametek had only three programmers. Despite this the developers hold the opinion that they only needed another six more months to bring the title to a beta stage before Gametek folded. Unfinished Nintendo 64 ROM images are available to download via the Crystal Dreams developers website.

Robotron 64
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Action
Release Year: 1998
Publisher: Crave Entertainment
Players: 1

Description

YOU CAN SAVE THE WORLD! All the excitement and speed of the original classic is back and updated with state-of-the-art graphics specifically designed for the N64. Intense, non-stop action versus a mechanical army of robots. 200 levels of frantic destruction in detailed, ever-changing 3D arenas. Multiple power-ups scattered throughout each level offer more powerful weaponry, as waves of never-ending Robotrons continue the attack. All the classic Robotron characters return, plus 26 new enemies, each rendered in 3D. Multitudes of hidden cheat codes and bonus rounds. 


Player 1's addictive retro-shooter promises lots of fun for old-school gamers with little left over for graphic tarts

Robotron 2084 hit the streets way back in 1984. The game was created by arcade legend Eugene Jarvis, who also developed such hits as Defender and Cruis'n USA. For its time, Robotron was as good as games got. It had excellent control, high-speed gameplay and players always had the feeling that they were one second away from dying. It was addictive and fun.

About a year ago, Robotron X was released for Sony PlayStation by newcomer Player 1. While the game had a new 3D polygonal engine and decent control, its retro graphics, annoying camera perspectives and limited control added up to a gaming experience that was far from impressive. And given the competition at the time, which consisted of games like Tomb Raider and Crash Bandicoot, the title quickly disappeared.

So why bring it to Nintendo 64? The team at Player 1 claims that it didn't have time to create the game it really wanted to for PlayStation and that Robotron 64 is a much more complete title. The major differences? Levels now have textures, unlike the PlayStation version, which had grids. Multiple camera angles are now working, and an optimized view of the action has finally been implemented. The PlayStation version's camera view was horrendous -- it zoomed in way too far, which made gameplay an annoyance if not an impossibility. But most importantly, the Nintendo 64 version uses the analog stick on two controllers at the same time. This addition is the most intuitive use of the Nintendo 64 controller yet, and frankly, it makes the game complete.

Graphics
Visually, there's not much to it. A solid 3D polygonal engine displays various shapes of textured grids all filled with various polygonal opponents. The textures on the grids are quite ugly, usually a shade of brown or dark green. And the background (which is a swirling graphic scheme of rainbow colors) mixes with the textured grid to give off horrendous '70s sensibility (although the '70s are back in style, right?). The 3D opponents are greatly lacking in detail. Women, men and children (who players must save) have no face textures, so close-up views reveal scary, expressionless zombies. If you buy videogames to impress your friends with the latest graphic achievements, stay away from this game.

Sound
The music is surprisingly good, resembling that level of quality found in Tetrisphere. Electronic beats and sound effects blend nicely for the techno backdrop, which is quickly becoming a standard for Nintendo 64 games. Despite the fact that there are more than 11 quality tracks on the cart, it does manage to become repetitive at times.

Gameplay
Let's make no bones about it, the game is retro, and what really matters in a game of this kind is its gameplay. After all, people aren't going to buy it for its graphics or groundbreaking engine, they're going to buy it for the gaming experience. Luckily, the gameplay is strong, highly addictive and downright fun due to two new features: The new camera angle which actually allows the game to be viewed (ahem, PlayStation), and its use of two controllers (analog sticks) for dead-on control.

Players shoot their way through tons of grid-levels, controlling a polygonal character with full freedom of movement. At any given time there are increasing multiples of opponents on screen, with little to no slow-down. Though killing everything in sight while saving humans (who run wildly around the grid) is the object of the game, players must also avoid legions of enemies who attack and acquire weapon power-ups and items.

A basic controller configuration similar to that of the PlayStation version is available, but the real fun comes with the addition of a second controller. How does it work? Players walk with the analog stick on one controller and shoot with the analog stick on another. It sounds odd, but it is absolutely ingenious and replicates the same double-joystick control of the original arcade machine. It allows for so much movement possibility that addiction is inevitable. For example, I sat down to play a few quick rounds before lunch today and by the time I realized it I had progressed through more than 70 levels. I would have continued on, too, had I not been killed off. It's safe to say that the addition of the second controller is one of the most intuitive gameplay enhancements in a long, long time.
Closing Comments
Those of you obsessed with graphics will hate this game. You won't find any eye-candy. And control scheme aside, it really doesn't offer gamers anything completely new or trend-setting, but instead delivers high amounts of brainless shooting and amazingly addictive gameplay that's both nostalgic and fun. If nothing else, give it a rent and don't forget the second controller.
Another Take

from Peer Schneider
Playing this game, I kept asking myself how cool it would be if Robotron 64 had super-smooth and sharp graphics with amazing explosions. Let's face it, with these ugly visuals, why bring the game into the third dimension at all? Fortunately, Robotron 64 offers highly addictive gameplay with cool dual-analog controls. For some, that may be enough. I just wish there were more reasons to shell out $39 over simply hooking up my Super NES and playing Crash TV with two players.

Description

Whoopie World, the greatest amusement park ever, is ready to open, but second-banana park mascot, Jojo the Raccoon, has gone nuts. He's taken over the park! Can Rocket, the most advanced amusement park robot ever, save the day? Rocket's a one wheel wonder with double-jump booster rockets and 7 cool cars to drive. He's got a tractor beam that can pick up almost anything, swing from ledges, trees, even toss freeze & smash objects. Rocket's got the moves & he's got the tools to make things right.


Story

Rocket belongs to Dr. Gavin, the architect and owner of Whoopie World, a futuristic zoo and theme park. On the night before opening day, he goes to a party, leaving Rocket in charge of all the animals and two mascots: Whoopie the walrus and his sidekick Jojo the raccoon. As soon as Gavin leaves, Rocket sees Jojo looking over his plans to ruin opening day and replace the park with Jojo World. Before he can do anything, Jojo knocks out Rocket with a mallet and takes the teleporter down into the park, bringing Whoopie with him. Now Rocket must rescue Whoopie, free the animals, find the tickets and tokens Jojo has scattered throughout the park, and catch the raccoon, all before Dr. Gavin returns.

 Gameplay

The game has six differently themed worlds (not including the final level), all connected to the main Whoopie World area. Each world is opened by finding a requisite amount of tickets in the other worlds. On the way, the player must learn new moves and techniques from a maintenance robot named Tinker in exchange for tokens found throughout the park. Each world has at least one vehicle, used for solving puzzles and getting tickets. After collecting enough tickets from throughout the park, the player can gain entry to the final stage, Jojo World, where Jojo is finally confronted.

Info

Rocket: Robot on Wheels is a video game for Nintendo 64, developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Ubisoft, released in 1999. In the game the player takes control over Rocket, the title robot, who despite the title has only one wheel. This was the first game developed by Sucker Punch Productions, who would later develop the Sly Cooper series and inFamous for Sony. Rocket was also notable for its use of a relatively advanced physics engine. The game had also been developed under the title Sprocket until three months before its release, when it was changed due to copyright concerns

Reception

Rugrats - Scavenger Hunt
Platform: Nintendo 64
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Board Game
Release Year: 1999
Developer: Realtime Associates
Publisher: THQ
Players: Single player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Rugrats - Treasure Hunt
_________________________
*
Description

Scavenge through three games in one! Reptar Rally: The babies visit Reptar on his candy island to help him collect as many sweets as possible. Angelica's Temple of Gloom: The babies are transported to the ancient Aztec Temple of Kokobola. Find all the pieces to the broken Aztec statue before Angelica does, or else... Pirate Treasure Hunt: Play diaper-to-diaper and search through a sunken pirate ship looking for hidden tresure!


Gameplay

Players control one of four babies including Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil. Angelica serves as the main antagonist, trying to snatch the items in question before the others. She also may take away items from you if you come in contact with her. Susie, Spike, and Grandpa (Lou Pickles) serve as allies doing various tasks such as giving you extra cookies when they come in contact with you. Dil Pickles, who became Tommy's baby brother in The Rugrats Movie, has returned on the "Mystery" space. He drives the Reptar Wagon and changes the identity of the spaces on the board.

There are three different game boards, Reptar Rally being the most distinctive. There is also a hidden square option that can be turned on or off at the start screen. Toy cards give you special abilities. One lets you turn into Reptar and travel up to five squares and stop anywhere you like, which can only be achieved normally when a "Set Spin" is selected randomly from the spinner.

The main goal, however, is to collect the most of a specific item. Stages usually begin with a brief cut scene to explain what needs to be collected, then the game begins. Items can be gathered after landing on the "Search" space, which can be recognized by the magnifying glass design. Searching may lead you to find only a dust bunny, but it is the only way to acquire certain items. If you find the "Double Search Power" tool when searching, you may search twice every turn.

You can also collect cookies, toy cards, and energy. Cookies are a form of currency that may provide opportunities for special bonuses. Toy cards can be purchases if one lands on a toy card space. They stretch the limits of game play for a single turn. Energy is needed to move from one space to another. If you run out of energy, you will begin to nap; there are also spaces for different sleep amounts.




Game boards

"Angelica's Temple of Gloom" has an Aztec setting. Stu has brought home statues that Angelica accidentally shatters. The babies must recover all of the missing statue pieces before Angelica finds hers to win.

"Pirate Treasure Hunt" involves the babies scuba diving under water to find hidden treasure near a sunken ship. After Stu shows the kids his replica of a pirate ship, Grandpa Lou tells (the beginning of) a story about pirates with treasure. They must find all four kinds of "pirate treasure" to win.

"Reptar Rally" is the only stage that changes the babies into dinosaurs (resembling the form of Reptar). Here they collect different types of candy on an island made of sweets. If they successfully collect candy from everyone else's stash, they win.

Sequel to "Flying dragon"


An updated version of the game entitled SD Hiryu no Ken Densetsu (SD??????, "SD Legend of the Fist of the Fying Dragon"?) was released in Japan only, and added more characters (such as Jack, Ryu, and Gofire from the Super Chinese series), items and a new gameplay mode. It also removed the more realistic "Virtual mode", favoring the super deformed "Quest mode".

Flying Dragon Info

Flying Dragon, known in Japan as Hiryu no Ken Twin (???????, Hiryu no Ken Tsuin?, "Twin Fists of the Flying Dragon"), is a fighting game with RPG elements. Released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, it was developed and published in Japan by Culture Brain, while it was published in North America and Europe by Natsume. The game received relatively low scores on specialized reviews at the time of its release. It had a sequel a year later titled as S.D. Hiryu no Ken Densetsu.

Its most notable feature was the game's SD mode that featured a character progression system, in which characters advance in levels as they become more experienced, and in which it is possible to collect credits and treasure items to equip characters with.

Flying Dragon was also an NES game released by Culture Brain in 1989[1], where the player controlled a martial artist trying to recover magical scrolls stolen by the evil Tusk Soldiers. It was afforded a nominal sequel with Flying Warriors.



Characters

The game consists of two different fighting modes, though the two share many common characters.

SD Version

    * Ryuhi - This hot blooded fighter is the leader of the "Dragon Warriors" and an expert with Kung Fu. His home country is China and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Ryuhi is considered to being the main character of the Hiryu No Ken series, due to the fact that he appears in neary every game of the series and that the storyline of Hiryu No Ken is often focused around him.

    * Hayato - This calm, gifted fighter, is familiar with all types of fighting styles. His Home country is Japan and his fighting style is Kobujutsu. Hayato is known best for being Ryuhi's friendly rival and a member of the "Dragon Warriors".

    * Suzaku - This mysterious evil man, set on revenge, plans on conquering the world. His home Country is the Underworld and his fighting style is Kung Fu. Suzaku is known for being the right-hand man of Ryumaou, the series' dark antagonist.

    * Yuka - A master of "Aiki-Jyujyutsu" she can throw any opponent. Her home country is Japan and her fighting style is Jyujyutsu. Yuka's pre-battle quotes to Ryuhi implies that she may in fact have a crush on him.

    * Robo no Hana - The Yokozuna of Robot Sumo, who dreams of becoming the best hero in the universe. He has no home country and his fighting style is Robot Sumo. It is to be noted that Robot Sumo is held on the distant planet of Dousokui, which probably means that Robo no Hana is an alien visiting Earth. It is also to be noted that Robo no Hana had originated from the Super Chinese series, in which he appears in Super Chinese Fighter for the Super Famicom.

    * Wiler - This Warrior is strong and reliable. He uses Martial Arts learned in the US Army. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mix of Martial Arts and amateur wrestling. Wiler is also known for being a member of the "Dragon Warriors"

    * Powers - The top wrestler of the NCW, he plans on being the strongest in the world. His home county is the United States and his fighting style is Pro Wrestling. His physical appearance makes him resemble the former professional wrestler The Ultimate Warrior.

    * Shouryu - This young ghost hunter uses ESP and he is currently training in Mexico. His home country is the United States and his fighting style is a mixture of martial arts and Lucha Libre wrestling. Shouryu is known for being a member of the "Dragon Warriors". It is hinted by their pre-battle quotes that Shouryu and Suzaku know each other from the past.

    * Bokuchin (unlockable character) - Possibly the most mysterious character of the bunch. His physical appearance makes him look like a doll brought to life. He has no known fighting style, home country, or even his own stage. He also has the most limited moveset of all the characters. Like Robo no Hana, Bokuchin had originated from the Super Chinese series, first appearing in Super Chinese 3 for the Famicom.

    * Ryumaou (unlockable character) - He is usually the main boss of both the SD and the Virtual modes. He rules the Underworld as the Devil King and is one of the fiercest and dangerous characters in the game. It is to be noted that the playable Ryumaou is a clone created by Shin Ryumaou, who is the boss for the clone.

Shadowgate 64 - Trials of the Four Towers

Media: Cartridge
Genre: Adventure
Release Year: 1999

Description

An ancient evil stirs. Reaching from beyond the grave, it warps the minds of men who would release it. Soon, very soon, the dreaded Warlock Lord will again be unleashed upon the land. This time there is no one to stop it. No one except for an unfortunate Halfling, caught in the middle of the cataclysmic events events unfolding within the ruins of Castle Shadowgate... This all-new adventure catapults you back into the world of the award-wining computer and NES masterpiece. A magical world now surrounding you in full 3D splendor. A world of wonder, which beckons you to unravel its mysteries.

Gameplay

Shadowgate 64 has the same first-person view of the first game, though this time the static screens were replaced by a full 3D roaming similar to that of the first-person shooters. Despite the change of perspective the core game is similar: the game relies mostly on solving puzzles and riddles rather than fighting enemies. The warden and dwarf-like guards are the only enemies to be found, and they have to be avoided. There are many instances in which Del can die, such as a fall from a moderate distance or dropping into deep water. The player must find ways around everything through interaction with the environment.

Unlike the extensive menu-based actions of the first game, Shadowgate 64 simplifies most of this actions down to two buttons, one as a generic action command, while other uses items.


Story

The game takes place centuries after the first Shadowgate where Lord Jair defeated Warlock, and claimed his position to the throne. However, as the time passed the kingdom started rotting into a gathering for thieves, bandits and other evil beings. The game takes the role of the mostly unseen Del Cottonwood, a halfling who traveled in a caravan but was imprisoned by the bandits when crossing Shadowgate while his traveling partners were murdered.

While in prison, Del finds a way to break free and embark on a quest that takes him through the Four Towers. Each one contains a different task Del must complete to proceed. Del utilizes books and the help of ghosts of deceased town members to learn the story of Shadowgate. Between his trials of the towers, Del explores the bleak and desolate castle town. Doing odd-jobs for the few villagers left, Del gains access to other towers and new areas, even is offered a way out of the castle walls but declines.

Characters

Del Cottenwood: you play the halfling adventurer, who is caught in a bandit raid. Having been brought to Shadowgate, he is caught up in a series of events that impact his own survival and that of the land.

Saul: The boy of woman who lives in Shadowgate's now-ghost town. He had a partner who helped him uncover the legendary Staff of Ages. His whereabouts are unknown.

Lakmir: Also known as "Lakmir the Wise" or "The Good Master." He was one of the original members of the Circle of Twelve. He sent Jair on the original quest to stop the Warlock Lord from raising the Behemoth. Now he is a ghost that haunts the halls of his former academy. He will help guide you along the way.

Belzar: One of Lakmir's final students. He was far more promising in skill than most, but he turned his ways to dark magic. Now he seeks to revive the Warlock Lord.

Talimar: goes by many names. Originally one of the Circle of Twelve with Lakmir, he became "Talimar the Black," or more colloquially, the Warlock Lord. He is imprisoned in the Chamber of Holding.

Lord Jair: the hero of the original Shadowgate, he will help you at the end.

D'Narth: the last of long line of Dragon Keepers.

Sequel

Shadowgate Rising was an adventure game game developed by Infinite Ventures for the Nintendo 64 but was never released. Originally intended to be a sequel to Shadowgate 64: Trials of the Four Towers, the project was abandoned because the Nintendo 64 was soon to be replaced by the GameCube

Plot

Shadow Man revolves around a man by the name of Michael LeRoi, a former English literature student made into the Shadow Man, a voodoo warrior. Ten years prior to the game's events, Mike flunked his classes and his gambling habits exhausted his funds, forcing him to take up work as a taxi cab driver in Chicago, all the while keeping his failure a secret from his family back home in New Orleans. During a routine drop-off one night, his passenger was killed in a drive-by shooting, leaving a briefcase containing $20,000 behind. Mike took the money back home to spend on his family, using it to pay for his younger brother Luke's operation, among other things. However, the gang tracked him down and began issuing threats against him and his family. In desperation, Mike sought out a bokor to give him protection against the gang's attacks. This protection worked, but only for him; Mike's entire family was killed in a drive-by, leaving only Mike alive, albeit barely.

Upon recovering from a coma and near-fatal injuries, Mike discovered he had lost his memory. The bokor tracked him down and collected the price for Mike's protection: Mike became his zombie slave, working under the pseudonym 'Zero'. Eventually, Mama Nettie, a powerful but dying voodoo priestess, arrived with several thugs to take revenge on the bokor for hits he had ordered against several of her gang members. In the ensuing chaos, Mama Nettie dragged Mike into a back room and used her remaining powers to forcibly implant the Mask of Shadows, a powerful voodoo artifact, into his chest. In doing so, Mike became the Shadow Man, the next in a long line of African voodoo warriors blessed by the gods with supernatural powers to protect both their native tribes and the entire world from threats crossing over from the spiritual plane known as Deadside — the place where everyone goes, without exception, when they die. In addition to his newfound powers, Mike regained his memory, which began to torment him endlessly. Unable to simply end his suffering due to his newfound immortality, Mike had little choice but to enter into Mama Nettie's service. It is here where the events of the game begin.

One night in 1999, after an evening spent with Mike, Mama Nettie has a prophetic dream in which five serial killers known as 'the Five', under the direction of an immensely powerful and evil being known as 'Legion', are attempting to bring about the Apocalypse by transporting an immortal army of hideous monsters to Earth (Liveside) through an enormous construction on Deadside simply called 'Asylum'. After awaking Mike, she tells him of this and instructs him to immediately travel to Deadside using his strong emotional attachment to his dead brother's teddy bear as a conduit and meet up with Jaunty, a skull-headed snake who acts as Nettie's eyes and ears in Deadside. This is where the adventure begins.




Characters

Protagonists

    * Michael LeRoi/Shadow Man: Mike is the character that the player takes control of throughout the entirety of the game. A failed English literature student turned hitman turned world-saving voodoo warrior, Mike has had a complex past (see above) and is haunted by the memories of his brother. He is voiced by Redd Pepper.
    * Mama Nettie: Agnetta, or Mama Nettie, is the powerful voodoo priestess who created the Mask of Shadows and controls the bearer of it. Hundreds of years old, she lives in the body of a young woman who betrayed her. She cannot travel to Deadside. She gives various forms of advice.
    * Jaunty: Kidnapped and slain by occult students. Nettie convinces him to work for her in exchange for a new body; fails to mention it would be a disfigured dwarf 'Lifeside' and a snake-skeleton 'Deadside'. Also gives advice.

Antagonists

    * Milton Pike (born July 4th, 1952): A member of the group of serial killers recruited by Legion known as 'The Five'. Known as the 'Video Nasty Killer' for sending police recordings of his crimes. He also served in the Vietnam war and the United States Army Special Forces. Not long before the events of the game Milton was apprehended by FBI agents after an intense gun battle and incarcerated in the fictional Gardelle County Jail in Texas, which is where he can be found in the game.
    * Marco Cruz (born March 13th, 1968): Another member of 'The Five'. Called the 'Repo Man' by police due to his modus operandi of gaining entry to people's homes under the guise of a repossession agent, Marco preyed on couples in and around the Death Valley and Mojave Desert areas. He also worked as a DJ for a short period of time before being imprisoned in Gardelle County Jail.
    * Avery Marx (born January 18th, 1973): Another member of 'The Five'. Known as the "Home Improvement Killer" because of his MO of cutting off the power to his victim's homes before stalking them in the dark wearing a pair of night vision goggles. Through several implications in his in-game dialogue, it appears that Avery was molested as a child by his own mother, whom he later killed. Part of his MO is to leave the skull of a canary with a written poem rolled up inside at the scenes of his crimes. As such he raises canaries at his home. He used the bodies of his slain victims to create "furniture" and a "decorative" river of blood for his hideout.
    * John G. Pierce/Jack The Ripper: Another member of 'The Five', John Pierce is a fictional character in the game based on the infamous real life serial killer of the Victorian era known only as Jack the Ripper. The game starts with a cut-scene in 1888 (the year of the 'Ripper' murders) in a sewer beneath London where Legion appears before John (who is an architect by trade) and convinces him to commit suicide so as to cross over to Deadside and design Legion's "Asylum", a place for all the "misunderstood individuals of this world" (serial killers, rapists, pedophiles etc.) to seek refuge. There he stays until 1999, when he returns to Liveside and begins killing again.
    * Victor Batrachian (born April 8th, 1961): Born to a wealthy banker in Geneva, Switzerland, Victor is the leader of 'The Five', known as "The Lizard King". Victor was quite a brilliant student, and by the end of his education held a Ph. D. in forensic psychiatry and was a licensed General Practitioner. This is when he began murdering his elderly female patients after convincing them to leave him large sums of money in their wills. As the heat rose in Europe, Victor used forged documents to attain a Green Card and emigrate to the US. Again he began killing, taunting the authorities with letters signed 'The Lizard King', but was eventually captured, tried and convicted for his crimes in the US. By the time the events of the game begin, he is awaiting punishment on death row in Gardelle County Jail. Victor is another of the game's boss characters. His surname may be an intentional pun on the developer's part, as "batrachos" (ßat?a???) means "frog" in Classic Greek.
    * Legion: Legion is the main antagonist of the game. It is never stated exactly what Legion is in the game, though it is implied in a small piece of text in the game's instruction manual, which at the final confromtation Shadow Man asked to him, "Who are you? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many". Legion also quotes and paraphrases this passage himself on several occasions throughout the game and, with increasing regularity towards the end of the game, refers to himself as 'we' or 'us'. The last few words of the passage, "for we are many", are also used as a sort of mantra by 'The Five'. Legion appears as a somewhat oddly dressed (wearing a grey morning coat, purple pin-stripe trousers and a bright yellow shirt) yet aristocratic man of between thirty and forty years of age wielding a cane-sword. However, most perturbing of all is Legion's mouth, which seems to be constantly bleeding. In addition to being the game's main antagonist, Legion is also the game's final boss.




Gameplay

Shadow Man is an action game comparable to games like Tomb Raider or the Legend of Zelda series. Most gameplay takes place in a third person perspective, though there is an option for first-person aiming. The player can run, jump, climb, swim and perform various other actions. Combat is focused on the use of firearms, the most important of which is the Shadowgun, a pistol through which Mike can channel his shadow power and reap life energy from his enemies. Numerous other weapons also exist, such as voodoo implements, ordinary Earth weapons, and some oddly-designed Deadside firearms.

Shadow Man is also one of few games of its time to feature a 3D targeting feature (pioneered by The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time a year earlier). This allowed for the player to lock-on to an enemy and strafe around them as desired during combat. Also unique to a game of its time, Shadow Man has a dual-wielding system, allowing the player to equip two items controlled by two different buttons/keys and use them independently of each other yet at the same time.

The main focus of Shadow Man is the collection of "Dark Souls", a set of 120 indestructible souls which imbue Mike with greater power once enough are absorbed. These are what Legion intends to implant into his army of monsters, thus making them immortal. As the player collects them their shadow power level will increase level by level (to a maximum of 10), which serves two purposes: it increases the charge potential of the Shadowgun so the player can cause more damage, and it determines what level of coffin gates (coffin-shaped doors that restrict access to portions of the game) the player can open in Deadside. The player's voodoo meter increases in tandem with their shadow level, allowing voodoo weapons to be used for greater periods.

A secondary focus of the game is the collection of the small ceremonial pots cadeaux (French for "gifts"). When the player has collected one-hundred cadeaux, they take whom to the Temple of Life and offer them to the Loa (gods of Deadside) so as to increase their life meter by one unit. There are five-hundred and twelve to collect in total, resulting in a possible ten health units.

Another point of interest is Shadow Man's non-linearity. The player can play through the game as he or she likes, with the only limitation being the number of dark souls in the player's possession. For example, the five main bosses of the game can be fought in any order provided the player has access to both whose shadow powers in Liveside and the relevant area.





Differences between the game and the comic

Apart from the underlying theme of voodoo mythology, both Shadow Man the game and the original Shadowman comic book series have very little to do with one another. The only real connection is the main character of the comic, Jack Boniface, making a small cameo in the game as a past Shadow Man mentioned by name only in a report that is available for the player's viewing in-game.

However, a second series of Shadowman comics (renamed Shadow Man, with the space that is present in the title of the game, or Shadowman V2) was launched near the release of the game. This second series and the game itself are nearly identical, sharing, among other things, Mike, Jaunty, and the revisited Mama Nettie.

Sim City 2000

Overview

The unexpected and enduring success of the original SimCity, combined with the relative lack of success with other "Sim" titles, finally motivated the development of a sequel. SimCity 2000 was a major extension of the concept; the view was now dimetric instead of overhead, land could have different elevations, and underground layers were introduced for water pipes and subways.

New types of facilities include prisons, schools, libraries, museums, marinas, zoos, hospitals and arcologies. Players can build highways, roads, bus depots, railway tracks, subways, train depots and zone land for seaports and airports. There are a total of nine varieties of power plants in SimCity 2000, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams (which can only be placed on waterfall tiles) and the futuristic fusion power and satellite microwave plant. Most types of power plants have a limited life span and must be rebuilt periodically.

Players can build highways to neighboring cities to increase trade and the population. The cities are named after British Science-Fiction sitcom characters notably from Red Dwarf.[2]

The budget and finance controls are also much more elaborate—tax rates can be set individually for residential, commercial and industrial zones. Enacting city ordinances and connecting to neighboring cities became possible. The budget controls are very important in running the city effectively.

Another new addition in SimCity 2000 is the query tool. Using the query tool on tiles reveals information such as structure name and type, altitude, and land value. Certain tiles also display additional information; power plants, for example, display the percentage of power being consumed when queried, and querying roads displays the amount of traffic on that tile. Querying a library and selecting "Ruminate" displays an essay written by Neil Gaiman.

Graphics were added for buildings under construction in the residential, commercial, and industrial zones, as well as darkened buildings depicting abandoned buildings as a result of urban decay.

News comes in the form of several pre-written newspaper articles with variable names that could either be called up immediately or could be subscribed to on a yearly basis. The newspaper option provided many humorous stories as well as relevant ones, such as new technology, warnings about aging power plant, recent disasters and opinion polls (highlighting city problems). SimCity 2000 is the only game in the entire series to have this feature (besides the discontinued children's version, SimTown), though newer versions have a news ticker. The newspapers had random titles (Times, Post, Herald, etc.), and prices based on the simulated year. Certain newspapers have a special monthly humor advice column by "Miss Sim". Some headlines have no purpose whatsoever in the game, such as "Bald Radio Found" or "Frog Convention".

Though there is no "true" victory sequence in SimCity 2000, the "exodus" is a close parallel. An "exodus" occurs during the year 2051 or later, when 350 or more Launch Arcologies are constructed; the following January each one "takes off" into space so that their inhabitants can form new civilizations on distant worlds (although the visual representation of the scene consists of the Arcologies exploding in a manner similar to bulldozed buildings, one by one).[3] This reduces the city's population to those who are not living in the Launch Arcologies, but it also opens wide areas for redevelopment and returns their construction cost to the city treasury. This is related to the event in SimEarth where all cities are moved into rocket-propelled domes that then leave to "found new worlds" (leaving no sapient life behind).

The game also included several playable "scenarios", in which the player must deal with a disaster (in most, but not all scenarios) and rebuild the city to meet a set of victory conditions. These were based in versions of real-life cities, and some were based on real events such as the 1991 Oakland firestorm, the 1989 Hurricane Hugo in Charleston, South Carolina, or dealing with the 1970's economic recession in Flint, Michigan—but also included more fanciful ones such as a "monster" destroying Hollywood in 2001. More scenarios added with the SCURK included a nuclear meltdown in Manhattan in 2007.

SimCity 2000 was the first Sim game to feature the semi-nonsensical phrase "Reticulating Splines", which means to make a network of splines. Will Wright has stated in an interview that the game does not actually reticulate splines when generating terrain, and he just inserted the phrase because it "sounded cool".[citation needed] The phrase has since been featured in SimCopter, SimCity 4, The Sims, The Sims 2, Spore, and The Sims 3 (Reticulating 4D Splines), as well as being referenced by a status messages in Mozy, an off-site backup solution offered by EMC Corporation, WinterBoard, an iPhone application, MailChimp, an email campaign management solution, Minecraft, an independently developed sandbox game, and Quake Live, a multi-platform variant of Quake III Arena that plays through a browser plug-in.

Sin and Punishment - Tsumi To Batsu
Platform: Nintendo 64
Region: Japan
Media: Cartridge
Genre: Shooter > Rail Shooter
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Treasure
Publisher: Nintendo
Players: Single player, multiplayer
Alternate Title: Tsumi To Batsu

Sin and Punishment, known in Japan as Tsumi to Batsu: Hoshi no Keishosha (???~??????~?, lit. "Sin and Punishment: Successor of the Earth"), is a rail shooter developed by Treasure and published by Nintendo. The game was released for the Nintendo 64 in Japan in 2000, and on the iQue Player in China in 2004.

Despite being a former Asia-exclusive release, it features extensive voice acting in English with subtitles in Japanese. As a result, it became one of the most requested Virtual Console titles in North America, with gaming site IGN declaring that there would be a "Very High" probability of its release after the initial announcement of the service.[1]

Sin and Punishment was released on the Virtual Console in Japan on September 20, 2007, in PAL regions on September 28, 2007 and in North America on October 1 2007.[2] The PAL and North American releases feature further translation, with English menus in addition to the English voice acting and the Japanese subtitles, offset by a higher Wii Points price, 200 more points than normal. Previously, the game had been fan-translated to English by a small website called Vanit Studios.[3] The game's success on Virtual Console prompted Nintendo to announce a sequel for the Wii titled Sin & Punishment: Star Successor, which was released in 2009

Plot

Mankind's prosperity has led to a vast population increase and serious food shortages. In an attempt to solve the food shortage problem, scientists create a new species to use for food, and place the herd in northern Japan. In time, the creatures mutate and attack the people of Japan. An international peacekeeping organization called the Armed Volunteers tries to stop the creatures, now referred to as "ruffians", but they also oppress the Japanese.

Another group, referring to itself as the Savior Group and led by a mysterious woman named Achi, rises up to defend Japan against the Ruffians and Armed Volunteers.

The game begins in Tokyo with Achi, Airan, and Saki embarking on a mission to steal an Armed Volunteer transport. After fighting through waves of Volunteer troops, they gain a transport on top of a building, but as they do, they are attacked by ruffians. After fending them off, Saki is attacked by a telekinetic woman named Kachua. Saki knocks her off the building. As she falls, the city is flooded with blood, and Saki falls as well. He and Kachua are transformed into giant ruffians as they fall. Saki kills Kachua, then turns on Airan and Achi. Achi teleports herself and Airan to safety.

They find themselves on a Volunteer ship, commanded by Brad, leader of the Armed Volunteers. Brad commands the fleet to attack Saki, referring to him as The Beast. Airan and Achi fight their way through the ship until they encounter Brad and Leda, a smaller cat-like Ruffian. After a brief fight, Leda is killed, but Brad jumps on a fighter jet and escapes, then Achi uses her telekinesis to help Airan pursue him. In the end, they kill Brad and wipe out the Volunteer fleet, allowing them to focus on Saki.

Achi believes that she can return Saki to his human form, but she requires that Airan shoot him in the head to incapacitate him. After she angrily refuses, Achi creates an illusion of Airan on a ruffian-infested train, tricking Airan into shooting Saki. They are able to communicate with Saki, but then Achi reveals that the war with the ruffians and the Armed Volunteers is merely training for her coming global war. As Achi becomes more and more menacing, Saki regains consciousness and teleports himself and Airan away.

Airan wakes up on a ruffian-infested beach accompanied by Saki, who is now half ruffian, but otherwise back to normal. They fight their way to the safety of a small building; once there, Achi appears, takes Airan, and flees. When Saki catches up to Achi, Achi asks him to help her take over the world. He refuses, and Achi tries to destroy the Earth. Saki transforms back into a giant ruffian and, with the help of Airan, stops Achi once and for all.

Snowboard Kids 2

Description

Just when you thought it was safe to hit the slopes... Here comes those kids to tear it up again in the outrageous sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. However, all is not well in Snow Town. Enter Damien, the mischievous little brat from the underworld... and he'll stop at nothing to ruin the fun of our Snowboard Kids. It's up to you and the rest of the Snowboard Kids to defeat the evil Damien! 

Plot

The game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists. The plot follows the daily lives and adventures of the kids, and the rather ridiculous attempts of Damien to sabotage them.

Gameplay

The gameplay of this game is almost identical to its predecessor's, but with a few differences.

There are now three distinct playing modes: the Story mode, which follows the game plot and uses the classical system of cash prizes by winning the races; the battle mode, which includes multiplayer mode; and the Training mode.

There were new additions and changes to the Items and Shots. All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below). Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.

The special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air. It also added the ability to repel Weapon attacks by performing a Trick or Board Grab in the imminence of the hit. The player can also look behind by pressing the R button.

Info

Snowboard Kids 2, released in Japan as Super Snobow Kids (???????, cho sunobo kizzu; ??? is a shortening of ???????), is a snowboarding video game developed by Racdym and published by Atlus. A PAL version of this game was released in Australia, but it was never released in Europe.

Alternate Title: Snowbow Kids

Description

Rip it up on nine courses worth of various terrain! Pull over 36 big air tricks in your quest for the ultimate deck. And with Rumble Pak compatibility, you'll definitely feel it if you stick those maneuvers or not! Featuring five characters, each with unique moves, five modes of play, including pipes, four-player battle races, and nine customizable beginning boards.

Plot

The kids are arguing about their snowboarding skills. The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.


Gameplay

In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds "Shots" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.

The game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.

There were several game mechanics that were unique to snowboard kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.




Info

Snowboard Kids, originally released in Japan as Snobow Kids (???????), is a snowboarding video game for the Nintendo 64. It was developed by Racdym and published by Atlus. The game features 10-year-old children (excluding Linda, who is 11) who snowboard down various courses, not necessarily involving snow. Many reviewers compared its style to that of the Mario Kart series. Snowboard Kids supports the Rumble Pak.


Trivia

    * In 1999, a sequel was released. It was released as Super Snobow Kids in Japan, and Snowboard Kids 2 in North America.
    * Similar to another 5th generation video game Astal, the only dub artist in this game is Lani Minella (better known as Rouge the Bat and Omochao in the Sonic The Hedgehog series from 2001-2004 and Nancy Drew from the Nancy Drew Computer Games). She voiced Slash, Nancy, Jam, Linda, Mr. Dog, and the announcer. The rest (Tommy and Shinobin) kept their original Japanese voices overseas

Players score points by answering questions first (correctly) and based on minigame ranking. Players lose points for questions answered incorrectly. The game is exclusively multiplayer, as when played by one player, there is no AI, so that player always wins, even with a negative score. Players have the option to "shaft" (pass on) a question to another player after opting to answer the question. The "shafted" player can then pass the question on again, or choose to answer the question him or herself. When "shafting", a question will always be answered, by the last "shafted" person.

Info

South Park Rally is a kart-style racing video game, based on the American animated comedy series South Park. Developed by Tantalus and published by Acclaim in 2000 – near the end of the third season of the show – for PlayStation, Windows (PC), Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast systems, the game includes many characters, vehicles, locations, items and other features inspired by or featured on the series. Development work on the title – based on Tantalus' own concept – was done on three platforms simultaneously, and took seven months.

South Park Rally was the third video game based on the series. Previously Acclaim has also published the games South Park (1998) and Chef's Luv Shack (1999). South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had little to do with the development of South Park Rally (as well as the two other Acclaim releases), although they did contribute a number of original lines of voice acting for it, as they do most of the voices on the show. Parker and Stone have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the games.South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! was released in 2009, nine years after Rally, by a different publisher.

Description

Silicon Valley was intended to be the most technologically advanced amusement park civilization has ever known. Shortly after take-off, it disappeared. Now, in the year 3000, it's back and on a collision course with Earth! It's up to you to conquer the 30 levels in four incredibly lavish environments, take control of the totally original, wacky and - at times - life threatening characters and unlock the mysteries of the Valley. It's all great fun but remember, the fate of the world is in your hands!


Storyline

The game's storyline revolves around a space station, home to numerous animals (the station was intended by the designer to be a "technologically advanced amusement park"), which was launched and, seven minutes into the launch, subsequently lost in the year 2001. Thought to have disappeared forever, it reappears in the year 3000, and its designer, Professor Cheese, mysteriously vanishes upon an excursion to the station. Following this, a duo of "Heroes for Hire", namely Danger Dan and his robotic partner, Evo, a perfect, "super-intelligent, self-evolving robot", and the end result of the Silicon Valley experiment. Danger Dan and Evo are dispatched to the station in order to investigate this disappearance. They arrive to find that over 1000 years, the animal cargo had evolved and merged with technology; examples including an electronically-powered fox with motorized wheels and a steam-powered hippopotamus. Throughout the course of the game, the space station is on a collision course with Earth, and it is the player's mission to save all of humanity. At the end of the game, Evo arrives at the control room in the center of the station. He confronts the Evil Brain, who, after watching Evo on his adventure through the station, is fascinated by Evo's abilities and wants to keep Evo to complete his collection of robotic animals. The Brain is interested in Evo because he believes that Evo's powers can lead him to domination of the galaxy. He claims that "with your body and my mind, we can rule the stars" The Brain is also threatening to fire his "Doomsday-o-Matic shrinkray" at the earth. Evo easily defeats the Brain with his laser-vision, but is unable to stop the Space Station from spinning out of control. The station finally collides with earth, landing in New York Harbor. In the process, all of the robotic animals escape from the station. Evo (now fully constructed) must run around New York City, searching out and terminating all of the animals before they terrorize or take over the planet.


Gameplay

Within the game, the player controls Evo, a robot who is reduced to no more than a crawling microchip during the crash into the station caused by a fight the heroes were having over which radio station to listen to. Without protection, Evo will lose energy at a steady rate. To survive, Evo must enter the bodies of the animals therein (who each possess their own abilities), in order to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in each level, collecting Evo's "purple power cells" along the way. As this progresses, Dan is trapped in the team's destroyed spaceship and does nothing but assign Evo his missions and watch the player's actions, occasionally commenting.

As the player progresses through the 4 distinct sections of the space station,(Euro-Eden, Arctic Kingdom, Jungle Safari, and Desert Adventure) he/she collects the scattered remains of Evo's protective shell suit, eventually re-assembling him for the final level.


Bugs and glitches

The game has been known to freeze up, but it is a rare occurrence. Freezes are more common when using the Expansion Pak. In some cases it is impossible to get past the first few start up screens if the Expansion Pak is present.

In some levels, the player may be able to pass through walls if hit at the right angle. This is more common in "Stinky Sewers", where the walls can be unstable. In places, the player may even pass through walls to the outside of the level which can result in the player dying instantly.

A further bug prevents the player from collecting all of the souvenirs in the game. Since this bug occurs, it is impossible for the player to complete the game and witness its proper ending. Collecting all of the souvenirs also unlocks a secret bonus level. This cannot be accessed normally because of the bug. However, it can be reached by entering a code at the level selection screen.

Trivia

# Scenes from this game are featured in the music video for Mouse On Mars' song "Twift Shoeblade". [
# The 'victory theme' heard after completing a level can be heard occasionally on one of the radio stations in DMA's 1999 game, Grand Theft Auto 2.
# In a recent interview[when?], drummer Jimmy Chamberlin stated that this was one of his favorite games he had ever played.

He spins a web, swings across the sky and lands with a somersault onto the Daily Bugle building. Who is this masked hero? It's you! Fight, jump and web-sling as Spider-Man as you take on a legion of sinister villains. The city is depending on you.


Plot

While attending a scientific demonstration hosted by the supposedly reformed Doctor Otto Octavius, Peter Parker (Spider-Man) witnesses the appearance of a Spider-Man impostor, who steals Doctor Octavius's experiment. Eddie Brock mistakes this for the real Spider-Man and tries to take pictures, but his camera is shattered by the Spider-Man impostor. Due to his failure, Brock grows angry and is worried that J. Jonah Jameson will fire him from his new job at the Daily Bugle; all of his rage causes the Venom symbiote to surface, and then swears revenge. Everyone present at the demonstration believes that Spider-Man took the experiment, causing the police to begin a manhunt for Spider-Man. Meanwhile, two mysterious people unleash a fog upon the streets of New York.

Spider-Man is told by Black Cat that the Jade Syndicate is robbing a bank and have taken hostages. After foiling the bank robbery, Spider-Man fights Scorpion in order to keep him from killing J. Jonah Jameson. After defeating Scorpion, Spider-Man is forced to flee from the police. Spider-Man encounters Daredevil who questions Spider-Man but is eventually convinced of his innocence, then states that he will spread the word about Spider-Man's innocence. Immediately after Daredevil leaves, Spider-Man is ambushed by a police chopper and is chased across the city. Upon ditching the helicopter, Spider-Man reunites with Black Cat, who alerts him to two new problems: Rhino is attacking a power plant and Venom has kidnapped Mary Jane Watson in order to lure Spider-Man. Spider-Man defeats Rhino at the power plant, but Black Cat is injured and kidnapped by unknown parties posing as paramedics.

Spider-Man discusses his recent situation with Human Torch, who assures him that things will get better and he will eventually succeed in getting everything right. Spider-Man is unable to locate Venom until the villain, newly obsessed with Spider-Man following the impostor's appearance, appears and leads Spider-Man on an elaborate chase through the sewers and in one portion, the subways which are filled with deadly traps. The player ends up meeting The Lizard who explains that Venom locked him down there and took control of the other lizard men. Lizard finally gives directions to Venom's hideout. After finally defeating Venom and rescuing Mary Jane, Spider-Man convinces Brock that someone has framed him. They reluctantly agree to work together to find the party responsible, starting with a visit to the Daily Bugle to search for information.

At the Bugle, Venom senses the presence of Carnage, his symbiote offspring, causing him to abandon Spider-Man, who deals with an infestation of symbiotes throughout the building. He finally locates the identity of the Spider-Man impostor: Mysterio. After being defeated by Spider-Man, Mysterio reveals that his bosses plan to infest New York with symbiotes, and that the fog that blankets the city acts as a beacon for the symbiotes that will prepare the citizens for symbiosis.

Mysterio's information leads Spider-Man to a warehouse that hides an enormous underground base in which the symbiotes that are cloned from Carnage's symbiote are being manufactured. Spider-Man learns that Mysterio was right when he runs into the Punisher at Warehouse 65. Spider-Man finds a path leading into an undersea base. After rescuing Black Cat, Spider-Man discovers the masterminds behind the plan: Carnage and Doctor Octopus/Doc Ock (Otto Octavius). After Carnage knocks out Venom, Spider-Man defeats both villains, but the Carnage symbiote fuses with Doctor Octopus to produce an enormous, out-of-control monster, called "Monster Ock". Monster Ock accidentally destroys the base, and Spider-Man barely escapes to the surface, where he is rescued by Captain America who was called by Black Cat and Venom.

Spider-Man is then shown playing cards with Captain America, Daredevil, and Punisher while Black Cat and Human Torch are dancing. Meanwhile in jail, Mysterio, Rhino, Scorpion, and a Jade Syndicate Thug are shown playing cards as Doctor Octopus is banging his head on the cell bars. Scorpion openly mocks them for having "All worked together but, you still couldn't beat spider-man"


Gameplay

The game sees players controlling Spider-Man as he goes through each level, either trying to reach the exit or complete a certain objective. Players must restart the current level if Spider-Man runs out of health, falls down a bottomless abyss, or fails certain objectives (such as letting a hostage die). Spider-Man is able to utilise his spider powers to traverse the environments, being able to crawl on walls and ceilings, swing short distances and instantly zip between certain points. In combat, Spider-Man can utilise a limited supply of web-cartridges to attack his enemies, either webbing them up to stall or defeat them, increasing the strength of his attacks, or forming an explosive barrier. Spider-Man can also find power-ups such as Spider-Armor which temporarily increases his strength and defense, and Fire Webbing which is effective against symbiotes.

Description

The Lylat system has been invaded! Join Fox McCloud and his Star Fox team as they fight to save the galaxy from the clutches of the evil Andross. Travel to many different 3-D worlds. Battle the enemy in the air and on the ground and listen in as Fox McCloud interacts with a cast of characters.

Gameplay

In Star Fox 64, the player controls one of the vehicles piloted by Fox McCloud, usually an Arwing. Most of the game takes place in "Corridor Mode", which forces Fox's vehicle down a fixed path straight forward through the environment. The player can maneuver somewhat around the path and slow their vehicle temporarily, but cannot truly stop or change direction. Some stages of the game, including many bosses, take place in "All-Range Mode" by comparison (As does Multi-Player Mode). In this variant the player can move freely within the confines of a large, rectangular arena to engage in combat.

In Corridor Mode, the player's vehicle can be maneuvered around the screen to dodge obstacles and shoot incoming enemies with laser cannons, and can also perform a somersault to get behind enemies or dodge projectiles. As in-game teammate Peppy Hare frequently advises, the player can also "Do a Barrel Roll!" AKA aileron roll in real life, to deflect lasers. The Arwing and Landmaster, unlike the Blue Marine, can also charge up their laser cannons to unleash a powerful lock-on laser. The Arwing can also perform one new maneuver in All-Range Mode: an Immelmann up-and-over to change direction. In-game, this is called a U-turn.

Power-ups found in-game include supply and shield rings to refill your vehicle's health bar, ultra-rare 1-Ups (extra lives) and weapons. The Arwing and Landmaster can hold up to 9 Smart Bombs at a time. But only the Arwing can use laser upgrades to improve its base firepower up to three times. If the player dies or loses a wing, the player loses the laser upgrades as well. Another laser upgrade or a separate item, the wing repair, will give them their wings back and enable the player to collect laser upgrades again. All power-ups carry over to the next level of the game.

Returning from the original Star Fox game are wingmen that fly beside the player in Arwings and are sometimes pursued into the player's field of view by enemies. The longer it takes the player to save the wingmen the more damage they will take, eventually forcing that wingman to retreat to the team's mothership, the Great Fox, for repairs. That wingman will remain unavailable on the Great Fox throughout the next level as well before finally returning. When flying alongside Fox, each wingman provides a different form of support. Slippy will scan the boss characters and display their life bar on-screen. Peppy will provide gameplay advice, and Falco Lombardi will help open up routes to harder levels. At some points in the game, other minor characters, such as Fox's old friend Bill or Falco's friend Katt, appear to help the team in different situations.

Among Star Fox 64's features is the in-game sampled voice speech that replaced the gibberish-like chatter from the original game. However, the original chatter, referred to as "Lylat" in the language option-screen, can be enabled in the PAL version, though the feature is not in the Japanese and American NTSC versions. This game relies much more heavily on dialogue than the original, and together with the cinematic sequences, they drive the story forward.

Star Wars - Rogue Squadron
Platform: Nintendo 64

Genre: Action > Shooter
Release Year: 1998
Developer: LucasArts

Description

Fly against the evil Empire! As Luke Skywalker, co-founder of the Rebel Alliance's elite Rogue Squadron, you must combat the evil Galactic Empire! Engage in intense, fast-paced planetary air-to-ground and air-to-air missions - dogfights, search and destroy, reconnaissance, bombing runs, rescue assignments and more! Pilot X-wings, Y-wings, A-wings, V-wings and Snowspeeders with powerful weapons in over 15 missions battling TIE fighters, TIE bombers, Imperial shuttles, AT-AT walkers, AT-STs and other challenging foes.

Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, where a war is fought between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The game's first fifteen levels occur six months after the Battle of Yavin—as depicted in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope—and before the events of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. As the Empire gathers strength for an all-out assault on the rebel forces, Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles form Rogue Squadron, a group comprising twelve of the most skilled X-wing pilots from the Rebel Alliance.

The sixteenth and final level of the game takes place during Dark Empire, six years after Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi's Battle of Endor. The Rebel Alliance has established the New Republic, which now controls three quarters of the galaxy. After the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, the Galactic Empire collapsed, but was reborn under a mysterious new leader (who is actually a clone of Palpatine). Rogue Squadron, now under the command of Wedge Antilles, continues to fight the Empire to protect the newly formed Republic.


Plot

The story is divided into four chapters, each of which starts with an opening crawl resembling those featured in the Star Wars films. Further story details are presented through the game's instruction manual, pre-mission briefings, character conversations during the game and in-game cut scenes. The game begins with Rogue Squadron briefly encountering the Empire at the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine. The team then executes escort and rescue missions on Barkhesh and Chorax, respectively.


The Rebels learn that Imperial officer Crix Madine wishes to defect to the Rebel Alliance. The Empire launches an attack on Corellia, where Madine is stationed, to prevent his departure. Rogue Squadron, with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon, fights off the Empire and helps escort Madine safely off the planet. Soon after, Rogue Squadron is joined by Gold Squadron, a group of Y-wings now led by Crix Madine; they are dispatched to the moon of Gerrard V to aid its quest for independence from the Empire. They encounter the 128th TIE interceptor Squadron and disable Kasan Moor's TIE.[19][20] When Rogue Squadron tells Moor that she has been taken prisoner, she offers to defect and provide the Rebel Alliance with Imperial intelligence.

With the help of Kasan Moor's intelligence, the Alliance launches three consecutive attacks on Imperial bases throughout the galaxy. After an assault on the Imperial Enclave, a facility on Kile II supporting the Empire's Naval operations, Wedge Antilles is ambushed by a group of TIEs and is taken captive. The Rebel Alliance tracks Wedge to an Imperial prison complex on the planet of Kessel. The remaining members of Rogue Squadron travel to Kessel and rescue him.

With Wedge Antilles free and Rogue Squadron again at full strength, the Rebel Alliance turns its attention to a new Imperial threat — Moff Kohl Seerdon. Seerdon is consolidating Imperial power in preparation for an attack aimed at capturing Thyferra, a planet which produces the healing substance bacta. Rogue Squadron is ordered to disrupt his operation with hit-and-run missions against key targets on Taloraan and Fest. In retaliation, Seerdon attacks and holds a city on the planet of Chandrila hostage.[26] Rogue Squadron and the Alliance strike back by initiating a Kasan Moor-engineered raid on an Imperial base located inside a volcano on Sullust. While still on Sullust, however, General Rieekan informs the Squadron that Moff Seerdon has used their raid as a diversion and begun his attack on Thyferra. With Seerdon in control of the planet's bacta and their own supply threatened, Rogue Squadron quickly reaches Thyferra, kills Seerdon and frees the planet.

In the final chapter, the game moves into the future, six years after the Battle of Endor. Rogue Squadron, now under the command of Wedge Antilles, continues to fight the wounded Empire. On the planet of Mon Calamari, new Imperial weapons called World Devastators are destroying the planet. Rogue Squadron is deployed, disables all three Devastators and destroys the Imperial presence

Description

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... As Luke Skywalker and the Rebel Alliance struggle to defeat Darth Vader and the Empire, a new threat arises. Dark Prince Xizor, head of the Black Sun crime syndicate, aspires to take Darth Vader's place at the Emperor's side. To do that, he must eliminate young Skywalker. As Dash Rendar, it's up to you to protect Luke and help the Alliance defeat the evil Xizor. Watch out for infamous bounty hunters and deadly stormtroopers! May the Force be with you!

Story

The main story is told by the novel written by Steve Perry, the comic series by Dark Horse, and the Nintendo 64/PC game. Each is designed to tell one part of the overall story; the story is complete only when all three venues are explored. The novel tells the overall story, focusing on the main characters. The comic book series focuses on bounty hunter Boba Fett's battle to keep possession of the frozen Han Solo. The video game allows players to control new character Dash Rendar, whose adventures in the game weave in and out of the overall storyline. All the while, a battle for the life of Luke Skywalker takes place between Darth Vader and Prince Xizor, as each tries to please Emperor Palpatine.

Description

Attention defenders of Naboo! The Trade Federation must be stopped! Storm through more than 15 missions over land, sea and space as your freedom fighters rally against the droid armies. Take control of 7 vehicles: the Naboo starfighter, Gian speeder, and new craft like the heavy STAP, Trade Federation gunboat and more. More than 15 missions: escape from Theed, search & destroy, sabotage, reconnaissance, convoy. Battle against Trade Federation droid starfighters, AATs, destroyer droids, battle droids.
Change vehicles mid-mission through specially designated hangars.

Gameplay

A follow-up to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Battle for Naboo is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15 levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level. Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).

The heads-up display features a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, land and water vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level.[10] Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game.

The player's performance is measured throughout the game, and performance statistics are checked after each level against four medal benchmarks. Each benchmark contains six categories: completion time, number of enemies destroyed, shot accuracy, number of friendly craft and structures saved, number of bonuses collected and lives remaining. If a player's performance exceeds one of the level's four benchmarks in all five categories, a medal—bronze, silver, gold or platinum—is awarded on completion. Unlike other medal benchmarks, platinum medal benchmarks are undisclosed to the player. Acquiring medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content

Description

Join Jedi-to-be Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars race of your life! Relive all the thrills and excitement of the Podracer sequence from Star Wars: Episode I. Hang on tight - with afterburners on, Podracers max out at a simulated 600 mph! Race in furious competition against more than 21 opponents! Take on over 21 tracks in 8 unique worlds. Avoid hazards such as methane lakes, meteor showers and Tusken Raiders! Featuring spectacular 3D environments!


Game Modes

The following is a list of different playing modes featured in the game:

    * Tournament: The primary game mode. Race for money to buy parts or pit droids, and unlock new tracks, racers, and upgrades. You can't decide how hard the other racers are going on you.
    * Free Race: Allows you to practice any previously unlocked courses using any unlocked racer. However, you cannot earn money or unlock tracks and racers. You can, however, set the difficulty of your opponents.
    * Time Attack: The same as Free Race, except you race against the clock, constantly trying to improve your time. In the PC version at least this mode is absent, with the free play mode allowing the player to instead set the amount of computer opponents to 0.
    * 2 Player: Race against another real player on any unlocked course. You can adjust the difficulty, number, and speed of the computer opponents.
    * Multiplayer: Race against other players on a local network on any unlocked course. The PC version uses the deprecated IPX protocol in order to accomplish this, while the Macintosh version uses the TCP/IP stack.

Can support up to 8 players


The Nintendo 64 version received a special edition Star Wars Episode I Racer hardware bundle with the standard gray/black console and a copy of the game. While the Nintendo 64 cartridge took advantage of Nintendo's Expansion Pak memory unit to add additional textures during in-game play, the N64 cartridge memory limitations resulted in all prerendered cinematics and all but one of the movie soundtrack tunes being removed from the game (Duel of the Fates).


Trivia

# Lucas Arts wanted to call this game Pod Racer, but an older game already existed with that name.
# Jake Lloyd, who played Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, also lent his voice talents to this game

Nintendo 64 version

In 2000, StarCraft 64 was released for the Nintendo 64, co-developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Mass Media Inc. The game featured all of the missions from both StarCraft and the expansion Brood War, as well as some exclusive missions, such as two different tutorials and a new secret mission, Resurrection IV.[61] Resurrection IV is set after the conclusion of Brood War, and follows Jim Raynor embarking on a mission to rescue the Brood War character Alexei Stukov, a vice admiral from Earth who has been captured by the Zerg. The Brood War missions required the use of a Nintendo 64 memory Expansion Pak to run.[62] In addition, StarCraft 64 features a split screen cooperative mode, allowing two players to control one force in-game.[63] StarCraft 64 was not as popular as the PC version, and lacked the online multiplayer capabilities and speech in mission briefings. In addition, cut scenes were shortened.[61] Blizzard Entertainment had previously considered a PlayStation port of the game, but it was decided that the game would instead be released on the Nintendo 64

Description

The future of racing is here! Stunt Racer 64 combines the cutthroat world of auto racing with incredible stunts to reach new heights in excitement! Jostle for position through roller coaster tracks worthy of a theme park. Stunt Racer 64 is more than just racing - it's a daredevil thrill ride! Featuring 11 daredevil tracks to conquer, including half pipes and stunt tracks, and 29 stylish retro vehicles with futuristic power upgrades. Accumulate cash by winning races and pulling off dangerous stunts to add vehicles to your collection with the prize money!

Features

Set in the future, the gameplay includes more than simple racing. Older vehicles (primarily those regarded even today as classics) are retrofitted with futuristic engine and turbo technology, in addition to jets mounted to allow the car to perform midair stunts. These stunts, including flips, barrel rolls, etc., allow the player to accumulate cash rewards during races on levitating tracks. Money accumulated is used to purchase new cars, as well as upgraded parts for cars.


Modes

    * Contest Mode - One player selects one of the starter cars, and races against a full tournament of computer characters. Although the character biographies hint that the computer characters have distinct racing personalities, there is no direct interaction with them. For each heat, a certain number of points is awarded for each place. The player must place high enough overall in each round to advance. There are five leagues to race through, each bringing an increasing level of difficulty, more opponents, more rounds, and more tracks. When a first-place overall finish is attained, the player races one-on-one against the league owner, with the prize of the league owner's car. The leagues are, in order of increasing difficulty:
          o Kid Cola's League
          o Bunny's League
          o Hill Bully's League
          o Big John's League
          o Dr. Death's League
    * Quick Race - One to four players can compete in an arcade-style race where the cash prizes do not accumulate above $1,000 (When a player reaches $1,000+, each $1,000 is traded for a Turbo that they can use to at any time to go faster.) The cars available (and their upgrade status) depends upon the game save last loaded in Contest Mode. The two main modes of the Quick Race are Single Race (with optional computer opponents) and Practice (with no computer opponents). The two stunt tracks, Half Pipe, and Stunt Bowl, are open only in Quick Race.

Cars

When a career is first started in Contest Mode, the player selects one of four starter cars: Warbird Light, Z-Bucket, Stottlemeyer, and Del Raye. Cash prizes can later be used to purchase the rest of these starter cars if desired, along with other cars that are available by purchase only. Among these aforementioned cars, once they reach full upgrade, a fancier version of the car comes up for sale. These "upgraded" cars cannot have their parts upgraded. Neither can the cars earned from league owners.

Description

Mario is super in a whole new way! Combining the finest 3-D graphics ever developed for a video game and an explosive sound track, Super Mario 64 becomes a new standard for video games. It's packed with bruising battles, daunting obstacle courses and underwater adventures. Retrieve the Power Stars from their hidden locations and confront your arch nemesis - Bowser, King of the Koopas!

Plot and setting

Super Mario 64 is set in Princess Peach's Castle, which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment, testing his or her player skills. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings.[17] Super Mario 64 begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him.[18] However, when he arrives, Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario searches the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle, while the final battle releases Peach from the stained-glass window above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by baking the cake that she had promised him

Gameplay

Super Mario 64 is a 3D platformer where the player controls Mario through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as pink "peace-loving" Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible.[17][19] The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses.[19] There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely.

Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario's abilities. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.[19] Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.

Platform: Nintendo 64
Genre: Adventure > Action > Platformer
Release Year: 2009
Players: 1
Original Title: Super Mario 64 - The Missing Stars (U hack) [!]
Hacked By: RHDNBot
Version: 1.1
_________________________
*
This is the first ever "complete" hack of Mario 64. None of the original
levels have been used and the gamplay has been changed in many aspects.


Main Features:
--------------

- 38 stars in about 10 levels
- A Day/night cycle replacing (most) act selectors
- Choose to play as Mario or Luigi
- Modified enemies, objects and bosses (too many to list!)
- Custom music, including one original song (the town "night" music).
- A new final boss fight

To switch between Mario and Luigi in the title screen, press D-pad Left
(Luigi) or D-Pad Right (Mario).

There are also many 'invisible' modifications that make make this hack work:
extended memory support, a new collision pointer system (lookup tables instead
of hardcoded pointers), modified script commands and a bunch of other minor
stuff. The source code for all these hacks will be available on my site futurely.

Thanks to the people who have contributed to this hack:

Celux - Secret Woods level and major help on the underground area.
RDX - Some music ports made with mml2m64
VL-Tone - Luigi model, as available from TT64 v0.5.9 onwards.
ZZT32 - a pretty cool guy :D who helped me working with MIPS-GCC.
Darkdata - Title screen background and name suggestion.
Stevoisiak - Beta testing some early versions and suggesting some nice improvements
Kostecki - Correcting some text.

Description

It's a Bumpin', Bruisin', Brawlin' Bash! The many worlds of Nintendo collide in the ultimate showdown of strength and skill! Up to four players can choose their favorite characters - complete with signature attacks - and go at it in Team Battles and Free-For-Alls. Or venture out on your own to conquer the 14 stages in single-player mode. Either way, Super Smash Bros. is a no-holds-barred action-fest that will keep you coming back for more!



Gameplay

Playable characters

The game includes twelve characters in total as playable characters. Every character featured in the game derives from a popular Nintendo franchise.[17] All characters have a symbol that appears behind their damage meter during a fight; this symbol represents what series they belong to, such as a Triforce symbol behind Link's damage meter and a Poké Ball emblem behind Pikachu. Furthermore, each character has recognizable moves from their original series, such as Samus's firearms from the Metroid series and Link's arsenal of weapons.[18] Eight characters are playable from the beginning of the game: Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox, and Pikachu. Four more characters can then be unlocked by completing different aspects of the game: Luigi, Captain Falcon, Ness and Jigglypuff.

The Super Smash Bros. series is a dramatic departure from many fighting games. Instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, Smash Bros players seek to knock opposing characters off the stage. In Super Smash Bros., characters have a damage total, represented by a percentage value, which rises as they take damage and can exceed 100%, but maxes out at 999%. As a character's percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, usually a set of suspended platforms.[9] When a character is knocked off the stage, the character may use jumping moves to (attempt to) return; as some characters' jumps are longer-ranged, they may have an easier time "recovering" than others.[10] Additionally, some characters are heavier than others, making it harder for an opponent to knock them off the edge but likewise harder to recover.

Each character possesses distinctive moves (such as Mario's fireball) as well as various weapons and power-ups which can be used in each stage. These items appear randomly in the form of beam swords, baseball bats, fans, turtle shells, and hammers. 

Super Smash Bros.'s play controls are greatly simplified in comparison to other fighting games. While traditional fighting games such as Street Fighter or Tekken require the player to memorize button-input combinations (sometimes lengthy and complicated, and often specific to a character), Smash Bros uses the same one-attack-button, one-control-stick-direction combinations to access all moves for all characters.[12] Characters are not limited to constantly facing their opponent, but may run around freely. Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters are also possible, allowing for a large variety of ways to attack.

During battles, items related to Nintendo games or merchandise fall onto the game field. These items have purposes ranging from inflicting damage on the opponent to restoring health to the player. Additionally, most stages have a theme relating to a Nintendo franchise or a specific Nintendo game and are interactive to the player. Although the stages are rendered in three dimensions, players can only move on a two-dimensional plane. Not all stages are available immediately; one stage must be "unlocked" by achieving ten particular requirements.

Single-player

Although the player can choose from five difficulty levels, the game's single-player mode always follows the same series of opponents. This game mode is called Classic Mode in sequels. The player will choose one unlocked character, and battle against a series of characters in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with only a limited amount of lives. If the player loses all of their lives (or runs out of time), they have the option to continue at the cost of a considerable sum of their overall points. Selecting yes will cut their score half and restart the battle. Selecting no or not selecting within a ten second countdown will result with a Game Over.
A scenery full of platforms, blocks and fences in the style of the Super Mario Bros. video game. On a platform, a boy wearing a baseball cap throws a bolt of lightning, and in another stand a round, pink creature wearing red shoes stands still.
Ness facing Kirby in the Mushroom Kingdom stage.

The "Break the Targets" minigame as well as the "Board the Platforms" minigame are two of the remaining single-player games. The objective of the minigames is to break each target or board each platform, respectively. The goal must be achieved without falling off each character-specific stage. The last one is the "Training Mode" section, where the player can choose any of the available characters and to choose the opponent, as well as any stage. When started, a menu can be brought up to gain almost any control, such as slowed game speed, spawning 

Multiplayer

Up to four people can play in multiplayer mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play. This gives each player a certain amount of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one loses each of their lives.

Audio

Super Smash Bros. features music from some of Nintendo's popular gaming franchises. While many are newly arranged for the game, some pieces are taken directly from their sources. The music for Super Smash Bros. was composed by Hirokazu Ando, who later returned as sound and music director in Super Smash Bros. Melee. A complete soundtrack for the in-game's music was released in Japan through Teichiku Records in 2000.

Super Smash Bros., known in Japan as Nintendo All Star! Dairanto Smash Brothers (????????????!?????????????, Nintendo Oru Suta! Dairanto Sumasshu Burazazu?, lit. "Nintendo All Star! Great Melee Smash Brothers"), is a fighting game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan on January 21, 1999, in North America on April 26, 1999, and in Europe on November 19, 1999. Super Smash Bros. is the first game in the Super Smash Bros. series, and was followed by Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo GameCube in 2001 and Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii in 2008. Super Smash Bros. was released for the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan on January 20, 2009, in Europe on June 12, 2009, and in North America on December 21, 2009.

The game is essentially a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby. Super Smash Bros. received mostly positive reviews from the media. It was commercially successful, selling over 4.9 million copies, with 2.93 million copies sold in the United States, and 1.97 million copies sold in Japan

Ride, Race, and Fly with Style! Choose from 24 top Supercross and Freestyle riders. Awesome handlebar-to-handlebar racing! 16 real stadium tracks develop grooves and ruts as the race develops. Realistic motorcycle handling in Pro mode or easier control in Beginner mode. Multiple game modes: Quick Race, Single Race, Season and Freestyle Jump-Off! Two-player split-screen gameplay and spectacular hi-res graphics!


Gameplay

Choose from among 24 real-world drivers and hit the track. When you want some competition, you will need to decide what type of action you want. If speed is your thing, play the Race mode and concentrate on finishing in first place. Should you prefer showmanship to speed, perform huge tricks and try to score as many points as possible with the judges in the Freestyle mode. In both modes you will have to contend with a true-to-life physics model, which makes the game a stop and start affair just like real supercross racing, and big tricks are harder to accomplish.

Supercross 2000 offers a range of race and freestyle modes. Quick Race is available for gamers who want to race without worrying about options. Similarly, a Quick Freestyle option is included. Additionally, there are Single Race, Freestyle, Practice and Season modes. Single Race lets one or two players race on 16 Supercross or five amateur tracks. The Freestyle mode is a timed competition for one or two players to see who can pull off the most stunts. Practice is for some solo action and includes an option for saving a ghost. Finally, there is a Season mode for one player to compete in the entire 16-track EA Sports Supercross Series.

Supercross fans will be delighted to know that Supercross 2000 contains all the important licenses. It's endorsed by the AMA and by Pace Motor Sports. It includes all 16 real stadium tracks from the EA Sports-sponsored series. It has 25 of the top Supercross and freestyle riders from the 1998 season and features play-by-play commentary from Art Eckman of ESPN and licensed music from Pulley and The Living End. There's even an option to switch between easier control (Beginner) and realistic control (Pro).

Description

Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen have disappeared - they've been kidnapped by the malevolent powers of Lex Luthor and Braniac, who have brought them into a virtual reality version of Metropolis. Superman must come to the rescue! The Man of Steel must work through this virtual dimension and find a way to conquer the evil masterminds that created it. Experience the incredible powers of Superman first-hand as you battle to rescue Lois Lane from the clutches of Metallo, then attempt to free Jimmy Olsen from the steel grip of Darkseid. Race into outer space to face Braniac's evil alien technology. Above all else, destroy Luthor's deadly dream of a virtual reality Metropolis!

Plot

Lex Luthor has created a virtual version of Metropolis. During a battle with Lex in his LexCorp office, Superman manages to witness the trapping of his friends Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Professor Emil Hamilton within the virtual realm. Superman enters Lex's interdimensional portal, where Luthor negotiates to Superman that he must fly through his maze of rings scattered across virtual Metropolis in order to save his friends. Other villains Superman battles in the game include Parasite and Brainiac.

Gameplay

Superman is an action-adventure platform game where the player assumes the role of Superman and is challenged to complete various tasks and puzzles throughout the game. Most of the levels in the game are restricted to two types of gameplay; in some levels, referred to as Ride Levels in the game's instruction manual, Superman is instructed to fly through a series of hoops by Lex Luthor; in between, he is also tasked to perform certain feats such as battling Luthor's minions the Dark Shadows and rescuing civilians from natural or artificial disasters.

In other levels, referred to as Maze Levels in the game's instruction manual, Superman has uncovered one of his friends from within one of Luthor's outposts, and must escape with them and defeat a boss. These levels are generally more rooted in action-adventure, and make great use of puzzle-solving. The game's "virtual Metropolis" in which these stages take place is filled with what the developers called "Kryptonite fog" in an apparent effort by Lex Luthor to diminish Superman's abilities (which is actually distance fog and is used as a technique to mask the game's poor

Tetris 64 (????64?) is a puzzle game for the Nintendo 64. It was released only in Japan in 1998. The whole game is in English. It is the only Nintendo 64 game that can make use of the Nintendo 64's bio sensor which was included with the game.

Tetris 64 offers a few variations on the original Tetris,

    * Tetris - The standard tetris game not differing from the original.
    * Giga Tetris - The normal tetris game, but with oversized tetrominoes which break up into smaller pieces.
    * Bio Tetris - The normal tetris game using the bio sensor. The game is sped up or slowed down depending on the user's heart rate.

Bio Sensor

The bio sensor is a Nintendo 64 accessory produced by SETA and only available in Japan. It was sold on its own or packaged with Tetris 64. The bio sensor looks like a Nintendo 64 controller pak with a wire coming out of it with a clip on the end. One end of the sensor plugs into the extension port on the Nintendo 64 controller, and the other end clips onto the player's ear. The device measures the user's heart rate.

Critical reception

The game was praised for its multiplayer mode, which at the time was the only Nintendo 64 Tetris game which allowed 4 player mode, while most puzzle games still had not made the step into the four-player arena,

    * "Tetris 64 manages to do so and delivers the best possible multiplayer gameplay." (IGN)

The game was also recommended for import to English speaking territories because all in-game text is in English. The game was criticized however for its poor graphics and simple backgrounds which could not compare to other Tetris games out on the system at the same time, such as Magical Tetris Challenge or

Description

What would you do if your friends were trapped at the core of a sphere layered in hundreds of Tetris pieces? You'd have a BLAST! Tetrisphere is a whole new way to play Tetris, the world's most popular home video puzzle game. Explore over 300 levels of unique 3D gameplay charged with high voltage action. Choose to take control of Wheels, Jak, Rocket, Gear, Turbine or Stomp to experience 3D puzzle excitement like never before!

Gameplay

In most Tetris titles, a player's score is incremented as a result of completing "lines", where a row of brick pieces that is without gaps is removed from the playing field. This both earns points and removes the completed row, making room for further pieces. However, in Tetrisphere, the goal is instead to remove bricks by forcing three of the same type of piece to touch as a result of a "drop". A drop is achieved when any brick falls, either as a direct result of the player releasing the currently held brick, or when the brick which supports it from below is removed by any method. When three bricks of the same type touch, this triggers a "reaction". When a reaction occurs, the three bricks will glow brightly and implode, removing themselves from the field of play. Any other same-shaped blocks which are touching that reaction will also be removed in a chain reaction. For example, if a player has lines of nested "Z" pieces, and then drops another "Z" directly on top of one of the nested "Z"s, the one which was dropped will cause the piece below to implode, in turn causing all identical pieces touching that piece to explode, and so on. The only exception is that the pieces involved (including the original three) must abide by the rules which dictate which pieces are "touching". For example, any two matching pieces which are stacked must be exactly on top of each other, if they are both to be removed. Laterally, each piece obeys the rules specific to its shape. As an illustration of this point, "O" pieces (a 2x2 square, colored blue) and "I" pieces (a 3x1 or 1x3 rectangle, colored green or yellow) must have full contact on one side with one full side of another piece of the same shape, but all other pieces are considered "touching" if any part of them is in contact with another of the same shape.


There is a penalty incurred each time a player drops a brick without starting a reaction. The player may be penalized three times during a given play period, after which the round ends. While the player is scrutinizing the playfield, searching for likely reactions, a green timer slowly counts down. When the timer reaches zero, a new yellow timer starts and the player begins to move towards the sphere at an increasingly fast pace (moving back to the default position for each piece dropped). That timer may also expire, causing a new and final red timer to begin, which moves the player towards the playfield even faster than the yellow timer. There is no penalty if the final timer reaches zero, but if the player gets too close to the playfield, the piece is dropped, causing a penalty if there is no reaction. The timer is slightly refilled for every piece removed, and is reset to a full green timer when a penalty is incurred. Removing 20 or more pieces will provide access to progressively more powerful assistive (or "magic") devices such as sticks of dynamite or rockets, that the player may employ at any time to remove large sections of the surface. Each type of explosive has its own pattern of removal, area of effect, and drawbacks. This also multiplies the player's score for each piece removed.

There are several modes of play available in Tetrisphere. The foremost single-player mode is "Rescue", which challenges the player to free a robot from the core of a sphere. As levels increase, the number of layers, size of the trapped robots, and types of pieces present increase. "Hide + Seek" has the same objective, and consists of a mix of different challenges, such as exposing a picture imprinted on the sphere's core. The "Puzzle" mode removes the drop timer, the combo weapons, and the infinite and random natures of the pieces supplied to the player. Instead, players must remove all blocks from the surface of the globe, given a finite number of sliding moves and drops of select pieces. The "Vs. CPU" and the two-player "Vs. Player" feature split-screen race to reveal a number of core squares. "Time-Trial" and "Practice" modes, as well as a training tutorial, are also available. Finally, a hidden "Lines" mode exists, where pieces cannot be dropped. Instead, blocks implode by themselves if three of the same type are lined up with each other.

Along the journey there'll be plenty of challenges - blustery blowing leaves to ride, icy terrain, falling boulders, menacing bees, pesky bats and more. Earn Tigger's very special "Tiggertastic Bounce" as a bonus!



Story

Winnie the Pooh decides to have a party for his friends but needs more honey. He asks Tigger, a tiger with spring-like tail, to help him collect the honey they will need to have the party. Other friends from the Hundred Acre Wood such as Owl, Rabbit, Kanga, Piglet and Roo, also help Tigger find the honey they'll need.

Gameplay

There are two forms of play in Tigger's Honey Hunt, 2 1/2 dimensional platformer style levels, and secondly one of three mini games, which make up 9 levels.[3] In the platform areas Tigger must find a required number of honey pots to exit a level, he can then return after collecting any of the two special bounces he learns along the way, which will help him find the rest of the 100 honey pots that are hidden in each of the platform levels, collecting all of them will unlock 4 photograph pieces that can be collected. There is one friend in each of the platform levels which needs Tigger's help finding a hidden item. Helping them will unlock a Time Trial challenge for that stage. Also hidden in the levels are pieces of photographs that when collected will unlock art work in the "Photo Album", each of the games objectives gives the player a percent of the 100% that is possible when playing the game. Also while most objects are not alive in the 8th level the player must find Roo.

Differences in releases

While all versions have the same items, the PlayStation and PC versions of the game have digital animated scenes with voice over, and mini clips from the cartoon, the N64 version does not have the voice messages or the cartoon scenes, which N64 Magazine describes as "something that looks, and plays as if it's something still half way through development.

Description

Rainbow Six is as close as it gets to the intensity of real-life tactical operations. You'll join an elite multi-national strike force hired by the world's governments to stop a group of deadly terrorists. Draw your team from a pool of specialists. Select authentic gear and weapons and infiltrate seized buildings to rescue hostages. Rainbow Six's explosive real-world action is coupled with spine-tingling tactics to create a gaming experience you won't soon forget.


Plot

It is the year 1999.

RAINBOW is a newly created multinational counter-terrorism unit, composed of elite soldiers from NATO countries, formed to address the growing problem of international terrorism. The organization's director is John Clark, and the team leader is Ding Chavez. The term "Rainbow Six" refers to the director of the organization, John Clark.

Soon after its inauguration, RAINBOW finds itself responding to a series of seemingly unrelated terrorist attacks by the Phoenix Group, a radical eco-terrorist organization. Throughout its investigation, RAINBOW is assisted and advised by John Brightling, chairman of the powerful bio-tech corporation Horizon Inc.

However, RAINBOW eventually learns that the Phoenix Group is actually a front for Horizon Inc itself. Brightling's company is developing a highly contagious strain of the Ebola virus, called "Brahma," with the ability to kill every human being on the planet. In order to protect "mother nature," John Brightling is planning to kill the entire human race, sparing only Brightling's chosen few, who will re-emerge and rebuild the planet into a scientific and environmentally-friendly utopia. To achieve this goal, he has used the scattered terrorist attacks to create fear of terrorism, which he then exploited in order to get a security contract for his own private security firm at the Olympic games. Brightling's plan is for his "security personnel" to unleash the virus at the games, spreading it to all the countries of the world.

RAINBOW succeeds in preventing the release of the virus at the Olympic games, and Brightling and his collaborators retreat to their Horizon Ark facility in the Brazilian jungle, from which they had originally planned to weather out the global holocaust. RAINBOW infiltrates the facility, killing all of Brightling's collaborators and capturing Brightling himself.

Origin

Red Storm had originally planned to do a special operations game featuring first-person action, and a team of operators rescuing hostages and taking out terrorists. Their first concept was modeled after the American FBI Hostage Rescue Team. Later they decided to make the concept more international, as HRT would only operate in the US, and renamed it "Black Ops" and incorporated operators from all over the world. It was then they found that Tom Clancy was writing a book about terrorism and a special team to combat it, so they rewrote some of the missions to fit within the book plot. The book was Rainbow Six so the game was renamed Rainbow Six. However, by the time they finished the game, the book was not yet finished. Thus, the plot of the game does not completely match the plot of the book

Description

Trouble up to your bow tie! Ed's toxic goo turned the world crazy - tomatoes are rioting, carrots are biting back, and Grogh the Hellish wants Ed's head! Help Ed right the wrongs in 12 wildly animated worlds -insane puzzles, killer vegetables, dangerous dungeons, and more. All caused by Ed. It's the biggest trouble anyone has ever gotten into, or out of! A strange brew of action adventure and mind-bending puzzles!


Story

The game begins with Ed, the protagonist, cleaning up the spaceship he is on. In the PC version, he is contemplating giving a present to his girlfriend. While he is working, he finds a can full of a strange substance sitting on a table. He drinks it, but it tastes horrible. Some of it drips on the floor, causing some screws on the floor to come to life. Depending on the version, Ed either disposes of the can out a garbage chute or he accidentally drops it into an open hole caused by the screws opening up.

The can falls to Earth and lands near a man named Grögh. He notices the drink’s mutagenic properties when it transforms the surrounding environment; when he drinks it, he is pleased with the results. When Ed’s superiors find out what happened and discover that it was Ed’s fault, he is ordered to clean up the mess he made.

Ed is to travel to Earth to retrieve the can, so that the scientists on the ship can make an antidote for the liquid. With the help of the doc and his daughter, Suzy, Ed gathers the parts required for a machine that will catapult him to Grögh's Kingdom. Ed enters Grögh's kingdom and confronts Grögh, who is driving a fearsome robot; in the end, Ed defeats Grögh and gets the can back from him.

Characters

Agent Ed : Ed is an alien; good but a little bit stupid. He has to repair his disaster. He is voiced by David Gasman.

Suzy : She is the daughter of the Doc and Ed's girlfriend. She is helping Ed in his adventure.

The Doc : Once free, the Doc helps Ed to go to Grögh's Castle to get his can back by inventing a machine.

Grögh : Grögh is the main antagonist of the game. A former drunkard viking who, after getting himself evicted from a bar for not paying his tab, managed to drink the Tonic and thus as a result, he is now the master around the world, stating that from then on, drinks are on him, and everyone would get a taste, and Ed must stop his reign.

Agent Xyz : Another character who helps Ed; this is a newspaper guy who explains to Ed how to get through his adventure.

Info

Tonic Trouble is a 3D platforming video game by Ubisoft Montreal, based on the Rayman series. The story follows the main character, Ed, after a magic potion spills on the Earth and causes vegetables to become living killers. The game was received poorly; critics cite poor controls, a wordy exposition, and sloppy graphics (on the N64 version). The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places. The game was slated to be released before Rayman 2: The Great Escape but eventually was released months after. The Game Boy Color version was only released in Europe.

It was released on the Game Boy Color, Nintendo 64 and PC.

Additionally, a beta version for the PC was released as Tonic Trouble: Special Edition, published by Guillemot. This version featured very different level designs and control scheme. It was given away by Compaq with new computers running Windows 98 in parts of Europe. A few differences are the additional guards not encountered in the Retail Version, larger and more open level designs, silver spades instead of thermometers for health power ups, and the lack of a final boss.

Description

Go Big, Go Pro! Skate as legendary Tony Hawk, or as one of nine top pros. Work your way up the ranks by landing suicidal tricks in brutal competitions to become the highest ranked skate champ! Great features such as: Signature Pro Moves, fully skateable worlds, head-to-head competition, and Instant Replay Mode.

Gameplay

The goal of the game is to successfully perform and combine aerials, flips, and grinds, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, and the amount of times the tricks have been used (the more often a trick is used, the less it's worth). Successful tricks also add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of "signature moves" which are worth a great deal more than normal tricks. Bails (falling off the skateboard due to poor landing) cause for no points to be awarded for the attempted trick and resets the special bar to empty.
The player, as Tony Hawk, has just collected all of the letters to spell "SKATE". Screenshot is of Dreamcast port.

In "Career Mode", the player has five tapes (i.e. objectives) to obtain in six of the nine levels. The player has only two minutes in which to obtain a tape after which their run ends. It is not necessary to get every given tape in a level in one run though, as individual objectives are marked off once completed. In each level, two of the tapes are acquired by reaching set scores (with the second score being two to three times the amount required for the first), one is obtained by collecting the five letters to spell "SKATE", and one is a hidden tape which the player must find by looking in secluded areas, and the last tape's requirement varies from level to level, but always involves doing something to five objects (e.g. "grind five tables"). The other three levels are competitions, where the goal is to receive a gold, silver, or bronze medal by ranking higher than the other skaters. In these levels, the basis for ranking is not the player's score, but the mean number of points given on a scale of one to ten by three computer AI judges after three sets.

The player can also play levels they have unlocked in "Career Mode" in "Single Session", where the object is to simply to get as high of a score as possible in two minutes, or "Free Skate", where there is no time limit

There are also three multiplayer modes playable between two people: "Graffiti", "Trick Attack", and "Horse".

Description

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game. Its addition of stellar new features (like Create-A-Park), and great game-play tweaks (the manual maneuver will be copied for years to come) made it the best installment in a killer series of games. Anyone who has ever skated the Philadelphia level will agree -- this game is a masterpiece of level design. Hell, it's a masterpiece all around. There isn't a bad park or dull moment, just pure gaming nirvana!

Gameplay

It features the series' trademark open-ended gameplay, in which the player (playing as a professional skateboarder) completes a number of missions which result in cash rewards. With money gained, the player can then purchase skill improvements and better skateboards. THPS2 was also the first game in the series to introduce the manual, a skateboarding trick where the performer balances on two wheels. This enables players to string together trick combos. The game also introduced the Noseslide, Tailslide, Bluntslide, Noseblunt, Feeble, and Overcrook grinds. It was also the first of the Pro Skater games to feature Create-a-Skater and Park Editor features, now staples in the series.

Some levels in Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 are designed for the player to complete a set number of tasks in two minutes. Such tasks include finding the S-K-A-T-E letters, high scores and finding a hidden tape somewhere in the level. Each of the non-competition levels contain ten tasks for a player to do, each task rewarding a player with cash. Cash is also scattered around the levels in order for players to find, increasing the use for replaying a level. Once a player has enough cash, they can continue on to a new level. The maximum amount of money that can be obtained in a single skater career is $150,000.00. The other type of levels are competition levels. The rating by the judges that a player receives is based on how much they score, variation of tricks, bails, and how much of the level they have used. The judges give scores based on these criteria, the highest and lowest are taken away, and the three scores are given an average. There are three runs total and the best two count. Competition levels also contain cash hidden for a player to collect.


Nintendo 64

Originally to be released along with the PlayStation version, but delayed to allow further sales of the first THPS for the console. Almost a year later, the game was released by the same company that brought the first Tony Hawk game to Nintendo 64, Edge of Reality. This version includes all of the features from the PlayStation version, including the Create-a-Skater and Park Editor. In addition to visual improvements (less jagged, smooth) like the Nintendo 64 version of the first game, a new level called Bike Headquarters (from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX) was added. Also added were a few new cheats, such as the 10x Point Multiplier and Max Turbo Mode codes. The amount of songs was reduced to six and portions of each one were cut.

Description

Smile, you beast. It's the world's fastest multi-player N64 racing, geared for people who love to cheat! Oh yeah. This baby's got it all! Ten wild cars. Five white-knuckle tracks. A beautifully giddy selection of wicked hair-pin turns, roller coaster hills and secret, shifty shortcuts. Plus: 6 full vocal BGM tunes. Challenging Mirror Racing Mode. The world's worst weather conditions. And: IT'S OKAY TO CHEAT! Once you get ahead you stay ahead by forcing the competition into interactive objects like traffic cones and road signs. Waaay cool. The one and only Top Gear Overdrive. Don't get mad. Get evil!

Gameplay

In the main mode of play, the player races through six seasons, each season containing more races from more tracks, and with faster cars competing.

At the beginning of the race the player would start at the back of the grid, at the start line. Computer players at the front of the grid would often start a third of the way around the first lap. Players started with three charges of nitrous oxide, which were used to give the player a temporary speed boost.

While racing, the player could pick up two power-ups: nitrous oxide and cash. The nitrous oxide could be used straight away, while the cash was added to the winnings at the end of the race and was used for buying upgrades to the player's car.

Shortcuts were available on each track, and often the use of these decided the outcome of the races, particularly in later seasons.

At the end of each race the player would be presented with a screen to allow for various upgrades to their car, such as to acceleration and handling. The player was also able to change their car for a better (or worse) vehicle and could buy extra nitrous oxide to use in the next race.

At the end of the season, if the player had placed fourth or better in all of that season's tracks, they were allowed to progress to the next season.

Description

Jump in, buckle up and drive yourself insane! Top Gear Rally will have your engines revving! No options on this baby - it comes fully equipped: 9 polygon cars, 5 intense tracks (Desert, Jungle, Mountain, coastline and Strip Mine), 4 high-performance game modes and multiple camera views!

Info 

On the Nintendo 64, Top Gear Rally features a realistic physics model with functioning suspension. At the time, this was an impressive new gameplay development.[citation needed] Road surfaces, including their imperfections, were accurately modeled to give the player the feeling of actually driving a car.

The performance of each vehicle in the game was unique. Not only with respect to engine power, but also areas such as tire grip, suspension stiffness, steering tightness, and between different drive-trains such as front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive. The game also features the possibility of damaging the vehicles, although the damage does not affect performance.

The game's graphics were considered quite advanced for a home console system, being better than the PlayStation's then-available offerings.[citation needed] Smooth, non-pixelated, texture-mapped surfaces, high-detail cars, and complex environments were displaying at a generally smooth frame rate. However, the number of on-screen vehicles couldn't exceed three without game speed being impaired.

Because neither Kemco or Boss Games Studios had licenses to use the real car names, the car names are somewhat disguised within the game. One can identify the cars by either looks or by the fact that the disguised names are often almost acronyms of the real names.

The game features a soundtrack consisting of tunes with a sort of trance-style. The electronic XM music was composed by Barry Leitch, who also worked on Super Nintendo Top Gear releases.

This version of Top Gear Rally was also released as a PC title called Boss Rally.

A noted gameplay flaw with the Nintendo 64 version of the game is that it is possible for the player to gain an immense advantage over the computer players by riding the rails on the sides of the road in most tracks. The rails don't slow the car down nearly as much as normal cornering or drifting, allowing the player to maintain top speed even through very sharp turns. Boss Games' later N64 title, World Driver Championship, did not have this oversight.

Description


If you're ready to step up to a realistic racing game, Top Gear Rally 2 is the one to beat. This is the first and only game on the N64 to feature point-to-point rally courses and authentic rally racers from Toyota, Subaru and Mitsubishi.

This isn't just simply the most realistic rally game on the planet - it's also the best!


Gameplay

The game's objective is the same as the prior version: race through different locations (like farms, jungles, deserts and mountains) with the possibility of changing the climate (clear, rain, and snow). The game will randomly chose whether it is day or night.

Reception

Top Gear Rally 2 received a review score of 90% in N64 Magazine UK. IGN gave Top Gear Rally 2 an impressive 8.2 out of 10 overall despite little criticism about the sound stating the music was "boring" and the presentation saying the menus were clunky

He can execute a jump and a double jump, as well as two attacks: his wrist laser and his spin attack, both of which can be charged. In addition, there are 5 power-ups that can be unlocked to help Buzz complete certain tasks.

The game starts out at Andy's house, as Al just kidnapped Woody. Buzz eventually leaves the house, then enters the neighborhood as he moves closer and closer to finding his friend, and once again needs to help his friends whilst achieving his goal to find Woody. Slinky, Hamm, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head are with you each level, to give you tips and bonuses.

There are fifteen levels in the game. The levels are grouped into five zones (3 levels per zone). Only the first level is available at first, but the player can unlock more levels by collecting Pizza Planet tokens. Each level starts with an FMV scene taken from the movie (except from the Nintendo 64 version—its low-capacity cartridge system meant that these movies were replaced with comic-strip type 'cutscenes'). In each level, there are five Pizza Planet tokens that the player must collect. The player must collect at least one token to unlock the subsequent level.

In the first level of every zone, Mr. Potato Head is missing a body part that the player has to retrieve in order to unlock a specific power-up. The power-ups are the Cosmic Shield (Level 1), Disc Launcher (Level 4), Rocket Boots (Level 7), Grappling Gun (Level 10), and Hover Boots (Level 13). Some Pizza Planet tokens can only be collected with the use of a power-up, while others are merely easier to collect with the use of a power-up. Returning to previous levels is required to obtain Pizza Planet tokens that couldn't be retrieved earlier without a certain power-up.

The tasks that Buzz needs to perform to gain a Pizza Planet token are: Finding five lost items (i.e. Bo-peeps sheep); collecting 50 coins for Hamm; competing in a race (i.e. against RC); do a certain task at a certain point (move boxes on the shelf in a basement; bounce on a rubber ducky in a pool; mix paints together; etc.); and finally defeating a boss. These tasks get harder as the game progresses.

In the last level of every zone, the player has to fight a boss to proceed to the next level. A certain number of tokens is required in order to access these "boss levels." When the player completes a boss level, a bonus movie will be unlocked, which can be viewed at any time. In the last boss level, the player will face three mini-bosses from previous levels all at once: the Prospector (Airport Infiltration), the Gunslinger (Al's Penthouse) and the Blacksmith (Tarmac Trouble).

 List of Levels

In the game are 15 levels available:

    * Level 1: Andy's House (Boss: Tin Robot) (Mr Potato Head: Ear)

Reception

Reception for the game has been positive. Metacritic based on 10 professional reviews, has rated the game a 8/10 for the N64 version, and 9.1/10 for the PS1 version. Most high points for the PlayStation is the fact the game contains FMV sequences, unlike the N64 version. Rotten Tomatoes rates the N64 version with a 78% "fresh" rating, while the PS1 has a 83% rating.

Plot

The mantle has been passed. You've become Protector of the Earth. You are now Turok Dinosaur Hunter.

The player assumes control of Tal'Set (Turok), a Native American time-traveling warrior. The mantle of Turok is passed down every generation to the eldest male. Each Turok is charged with protecting the barrier between Earth and the Lost Land, a primitive world where time has no meaning. The Lost Land is inhabited by a variety of creatures, from dinosaurs to aliens. An evil overlord known as the Campaigner seeks an ancient artifact known as the Chronoscepter, a weapon so powerful that it was broken into pieces to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The Campaigner plans on using a focusing array to magnify the Chronoscepter's power, destroying the barriers that separate the ages of time and rule the universe. Turok vows to find the Chronoscepter's eight pieces and prevent the Campaigner's schemes

Info

Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is a first-person shooter video game developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Acclaim for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and personal computer platforms. It was released on March 4, 1997 in North America and Europe. Turok is an adaptation of the Acclaim Comics comic book series of the same name. The player controls a Native American warrior, Turok, who must stop the evil Campaigner from conquering the universe with an ancient and powerful weapon.

Turok was Acclaim's first exclusive title for the Nintendo 64 and was part of a strategy to develop games internally and license merchandise; Acclaim acquired the rights to Turok when it purchased Acclaim Comics (né Valiant) in 1994. Suffering from cash flow problems and falling sales, Turok became Acclaim's best hope for a financial turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's graphics capabilities to its limits, and were forced to compress or cut elements to fit the game on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs delayed the game's release from holiday 1996 to 1997.

Critical reception of Turok was highly positive. Becoming one of the most popular games for the console on release, Turok won praise for its graphics and evolution of the genre. Complaints centered on graphical slowdowns caused by multiple enemies appearing onscreen and occasionally awkward controls. The game sold 1.5 million copies and boosted sales of the Nintendo 64. Turok founded a video game franchise that currently includes six sequels.

In the Single-Player Campaign, the player must go through a number of death matches through the various game mode types, and must face all four game bosses as well. Each character in the game must be played to the end of their campaign at least once to unlock other characters and rewards, including Talismans, and an increase in maximum health.
    * Two-Player Trials Mode - Similar to the Single-Player Campaign except two players work together through various game types to gain rewards. Some rewards can only be gained in the Two-Player Campaign. (Note: The Two-Player trials mode was affected by a glitch in early copies of the Nintendo 64 game, which prevented progressing past a certain point.)
    * Multiplayer - In this mode the player can choose their character and choose what level to play. The player can choose their weapons and configure their own options for gameplay. (Frag Limits, Time Limits, Bots, etc.) The player starts with Turok, Adon, Bio Bot Elite, and Mantid Drone as the first playable characters.

    * Bloodlust - Standard free-for-all deathmatch that can house two to four players.

    * Capture the Flag - At any given time there is only one flag per map. The object of this game is to find the flag a bring it back to your base, scoring a point. At this point, another flag appears in a randomly generated part of the map.
    * Frag Tag - Similar to Turok 2, in this game a random player is transformed into a monkey. Points are scored for other players by fragging the monkey. It is possible to temporarily turn the other players into monkeys if you are the original.

Weapons

The available weapons in the game are divided into three ammo types - bullet rounds, energy rounds, and explosive rounds. A player may only carry six pre-selected weapons in the game - a melee weapon (standard for all), two bullet weapons, two energy weapons, and one explosive weapon. All these weapons have a primary and secondary function. Additionally, there are four pick-up weapons that appear throughout the game. If the player unlocks Tal'Set, they are not limited to carrying six weapons. Tal'Set has access to every weapon in the game at once.
[edit] Power Core

A Power Core, or Power Pill, is glowing pink-and-blue crystalline item floating in a set location of an arena map. Most maps have one, while some have two. They are somewhat similar to the "Power Ups" in Quake III Arena in that they give any player who picks one up, temporary powers that make them more dangerous. These powers are randomly selected. When one is picked up, a lightning bolt is displayed in a lower corner of the player's screen. Each Power Core lasts approximately 15 to 20 seconds. An in-game glitch exists if the player has the "Infinite Ammo" cheat activated and is armed with the minigun. Once the Power Core is obtained, if the player presses and holds down the secondary fire energy shield and keeps it held down constantly, they can retain whichever Power Core they have indefinitely.
[edit] Medals

There are 50 medals in the game that can be earned. These are needed to unlock some cheats and character skins. Medal rewards range from defeating bosses, to medals awarded for suicides. On the Nintendo 64 version, one of the medals is impossible to achieve in early (black-cartridge) copies of the game, due to a Two-Player Trials glitch in the "Creature Tag" levels.

Only evil this dark could bring him back. Only a game this big can do him justice. Turok 2: Seeds of Evil! Pick off distant enemies with deadly sniper weapons, and enjoy ferocious multi-player deathmatches!

Story

The game begins with the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, appearing through a portal to face a blue-skinned woman named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Lands, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat a powerful alien entity called the Primagen[5], which was awakened when Tal'Set destroyed the Chronoscepter in the previous game.

The Primagen is a creature imprisoned long ago in the wreckage of his spacecraft after attempting to conquer a place called the Lost Lands; a bizarre and barbarian world where "Time has no meaning". Sealed in the ruined craft with five devices called Energy Totems, the Primagen has mobilized several races of creatures in an attempt to destroy these objects.[6] Turok's task is thus clear; he must locate the Energy Totems and destroy all forces mobilized to attack them, and then destroy the Primagen himself to end the threat he poses to the Lost Land once and for all.[7] In the process, he must defeat the Primagen's armies and acquire ancient magical powers from the Talisman chambers. Eventually, Turok faces the Primagen himself. How the Primagen dies and the game's ending depends on what the player did during the game. If not all of the objectives are completed, the Primagen will collapse from his fatal injuries. When talking to Adon, she thanks Joshua for his efforts, but states that although the Primagen's body was fatally injured, traces of his psychic powers seem to remain, causing her to wonder if he's really dead. If all of the objectives are completed, the Primagen will be obliterated by a series of energy blasts from the totems. Adon will give a greater thanks to Joshua and state the Primagen's body is destroyed and no traces of his powers remain. Once the credits have finished rolling, the player will hear Oblivion say "It is inevitable."

Throughout the game, a mysterious entity calling itself "Oblivion" attempts to thwart Turok's quest by creating false copies of the Talisman chamber portals that lead to areas populated by its servants, the Flesh Eaters.[6] This sets up the plot for the sequel, in which two new Turoks must take on Oblivion itself.


Like its predecessor, in Turok 2 the player is armed with different types of weapons in order to kill enemies. New to the game are mission objectives to perform, such as destroying ammunition dumps or activating beacons. These objectives have to be completed in order to finish the level. After doing so, the player must protect an Energy Totem from enemy onslaught, and then can proceed to the next level. Introduced in Turok 2 are five types of talismans scattered throughout the levels.[6] These give Turok various powers, such as the Leap of Faith, allowing him to jump long distances, and Firewalk, granting him the ability to walk over lava.[6]

New types of enemies appear in Seeds of Evil, such as the humanoid Endtrails, the Blind Ones, large spiders, and the Primagen's semi-robotic Troopers.[6] The enemy artificial intelligence has been significantly enhanced, and some foes will run away if the player is brandishing a particularly powerful weapon. In some other cases, enemies can sporadically get into lethal fights with one another. Seeds of Evil also has a dismemberment system, where arms, legs, heads, and other body parts can be removed by targeting specific points on enemy bodies.

The game features a large arsenal, ranging from Dinosaur Hunter's bow and arrow to the Cerebral Bore, which was inspired by the Tall Man's weapons from the movie Phantasm.[8] The flamethrower is noted as the first of its kind in video game history to include polygonal fire.[9] Included in the sequel are weapons specifically for underwater use, such as the speargun and torpedo launcher.[6] Fireseed also has the ability to mount various different kinds of Dinosaurs; such as a Styracosaurus equipped with plasma canons, machine guns and flame-throwers; and a machine gun-studded Herrerasaurus. The final weapon, the Nuke, is broken up into pieces that the player can find throughout the game, similar to the Chronosceptor from the previous installment.
[edit] Multiplayer

The game features a multiplayer mode for up to four players.[6] There are various characters to pick from; they each had certain strengths and weaknesses, some being able to regenerate health. Most notable is the Raptor, which is limited to close-range attacks, but extremely fast and agile.[6] Also available is Tal 'Set, the protagonist of Dinosaur Hunter, and various enemies from the game.[6]
Turok 2 features the distance fog that was seen in the predecessor.

There are three available multiplayer game modes: a regular free-for-all deathmatch, team deathmatch, and a unique "Frag Tag" mode.[10] The Frag Tag mode starts with a random player transformed into a monkey, with no attacks and very little health. This player's task is to get to a specific point in the level; at this point, they would be returned to their normal character and another player made to become the monkey.[10] If they were killed, they would remain a monkey when they reappeared.

Gameplay

The PC version of the game includes an online muliplayer that differs from the Nintendo 64 version. The weapons of the online multiplayer are almost the same as the single player, except for the Scorpion Missile Launcher not having its lock on, No Razor Wind and Mine weapons. The multiplayer has three versions of online play. Arena, Capture The Flag, and Rok (Deathmatch). Arena lets two teams or players face each other in a small level. The host is allowed to edit what weapons and how much health a player can receive. Capture the flag gives points for Frags, and capturing the opponents flags. A team is unable to score points for a flag capture if a teams own flag is captured. Rok is the same thing as deathmatch; multiple players trying to accomplish the frag/pain (Damage) limit.

Development


The game was announced even before Dinosaur Hunter was released, under the title Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Part Two.[11] The game was completed in 21 months[12] with a team comprising of roughly the same size as that who worked on Dinosaur Hunter, which was composed of 18 people.[13] During development, more staff were brought onboard to assist in completing the game.[12] Reportedly, over 10,000 hours of game testing was conducted during its creation.[12] The game was originally designed with a 12MB cartridge in mind. When cartridges prices fell, the storage was increased to 16MB allowing the team to add a multiplayer mode. Eventually, the cartridge size was increased again, and was finalised at 32MB.

The base idea for the Cerebral Bore weapon was created during a brainstorming session concerning weapon design. The original concept had the weapon "being slow and agonizing".[14] An artist suggested a Leech gun, which was rejected by project manager, David Dienstbier [14]: however, a "Vampire Gun" was eventually added to the sequel, Turok 3. Iguana, having received Nintendo 64DD development kits which included the 4MB Expansion Pak, added a high-resolution mode to the game early on in the development timeline. This was demonstrated to Nintendo at E3 98, running at a resolution of 640 x 480, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time.[14] Before the official unveiling of the Expansion Pak, IGN asked Dienstbier about the possibility of the game running in the high resolution mode in the leadup to the 1998 E3. He stated that it ran in the same resolution as the first Turok game.

Acclaim missed the original cartridge production slot for the game, forcing a delay from November to December 98. This delay was due to problems in fitting the game on a 32MB cartridge.

Oblivion is a monstrous cosmic entity that consumed everything in its path. It reigned before the birth of our universe. Invading the bodies of the living and devouring them from the inside-out, Oblivion fed on the very energy of the dead and dying. When the Primagen's Lightship was destroyed, the chain reaction it triggered as a result was so powerful that the universe as it existed was completely eradicated, and the almighty Oblivion was pushed to the very brink of destruction. For the first time, Oblivion felt pain, fear, and hate. Though totally ravaged, Oblivion survived and now desperately seeks a means to punch through the Netherscape that separates our world from the Lost Lands (a strange and primitive world where "time has no meaning"), and the Lost Lands from countless others. The last shreds of the pure energy source that created our world and nearly wiped out Oblivion are contained within the Light Burden, the bag that every member of the Turok lineage has carried. The death of the Turok mantle will signal the beginning of the end: the rebirth of Oblivion. To help it in its quest, Oblivion has utilized the aid of hundreds of its spawn-offspring. These creatures, collectively known as "The Sons of Darkness" are fanatical worshipers of their lord Oblivion. Deep within the Lost Lands, Oblivion's henchmen have a massive headquarters from where they assemble their armies, direct their operations, and center their cults, which worships Oblivion like a God. The player will eventually have to infiltrate this headquarters to destroy the scourge of the universe. It is here that their destiny will unfold, here that they must bring oblivion to that which was thought eternal...Oblivion itself.

The game begins with Joshua Fireseed (the current Turok), his sister, Danielle, and brother, Joseph. Danielle's husband has just died, and Joshua has dreams of a child that must be protected, as he is the last of the Fireseed lineage. During the night, Oblivion Spawns teleport into their home and try to kill Joshua in his sleep. He catches them and fights, but is outnumbered. He tells Danielle and Joseph to escape, while he stays behind with a bomb in his hand to blow the Spawns away, along with himself. He is apparently killed in doing so, while Danielle and Joseph drive away. They are attacked by a monster, but Adon (a female alien who helped Turok in the previous game) comes in and saves them, then teleports them to a council meeting to deal with the situation of Oblivion. They decide that either Danielle or Joseph must become the next Turok, and the player gets to choose. Danielle is a character more built on firepower with a grappling hook, while Joseph is more of a stealth-type character with night-vision goggles. In the cinemas however, it is implied that they go together in their missions.

Gameplay

From the standards of Turok 2, the game simplifies itself slightly by removing such features as secondary ammo and access to exclusively underwater weapons (all weapons work underwater). Joseph and Danielle share some of the same weapons, but also have some unique weapons of their own that the other cannot receive; however, if the player manages to unlock Joshua Fireseed as a playable character by beating the game on Oblivion difficulty (the highest difficult setting) without dying or cheating, he will receive every weapon. Every weapon in the game has an upgrade excluding the Vampire Gun and PSG.

Description

This is it! The fast-paced, intense snowboarding action you've been waiting for! TWISTED EDGE: EXTREME SNOWBOARDING! The sickest tricks, the biggest air and runs you've only dreamt about 'til now. No more searching for the best ride ever, grab your controller and prepare to get twisted! Loaded with riders, boards, and secrets - each with their own unique qualities. There's lots available, but only if you aren't slackin' off in your ridin' skills! Performance is everything and it pays off in TWISTED EDGE!

Development

Twisted Edge Snowboarding' was announced on June 9, 1997. Many gamers at the time were excited to hear that the company behind Top Gear Rally (the successful racing simulation) was going to be Boss Studios, and were to make their second video game for the Nintendo 64. Kemco was to publish the game, but Midway acquired the rights to publish the game on October 13, 1997. On January 22, 1998, the game was delayed for 4 months. The game was finally released on November 10, 1998 in the United States.

Reception

Critics panned the game. Reviewers were calling the game a "Huge Let Down". Reviewers criticized Boss for delaying the game for 4 months to make the game a "Better Game As Possible". By pushing back the title, "1080" was released in between Twisted's delay, which sold more game cartridges and is now being called as a "Classic". Everything about the game was mediocre. Music was pleasurable although the Gameplay was frustrating to play and the Graphics was not like 1080's standards.

Twisted Edge Extreme Snowboarding is the third snowboarding game released for the Nintendo 64 after Snowboard Kids then 1080° Snowboarding. It is known in Japan as King Hill 64: Extreme Snowboarding. While Twisted Edge was not very well received commercially or critically, it covered the snowboard niche between Cool Boarders 2 and 1080° Snowboarding by focusing on tricks (unlike 1080°, which focused on racing), and providing a more intuitive control system than that found in Cool Boarders 2.

Description

Take the wheel as fully-loaded auto combat revs into high gear for the first time on the Nintendo 64. It's a down and dirty, gear-grinding, metal-piercing war on wheels. So get in. Sit down. Blow stuff up! Drive all 8 screamin' V-8's, plus 5 bonus cars! Fight in 8 fully destructible arenas! Go at it in 2 to 4 player battles with co-op and "smear" options. 


The game's storyline is built around an alternate history, in which there was a worldwide oil crisis in the 1970s and the U.S. was on the verge of an economic breakdown. Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.

OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the "Coyotes," they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region. With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the "Vigilantes," this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.

What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.


Gameplay

The game includes a variety of weapons, most of which are picked up during gameplay. Every vehicle is equipped with the Mosquito Machine Gun by default (which is relatively weak on its own, but has infinite ammunition).

Description

The future of auto-combat is here! If it drives by, blow it up! Choose from 18 all-new 70's and futuristic vehicles, and 8 new destructible arenas with hidden power-ups. Earn points to upgrade your vehicle. Blast through insane 1 - 4 player action!

The story of Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense centers on the international meddlings of an oil conglomerate from the future known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime).

After finding an electronic armband in a service station bathroom, former Vigilante Slick Clyde rose to be controlled by OMAR. Working up through the ranks of command he soon came to be the CEO of OMAR itself and made a complete monopoly on all oil trades with the sole exception of the United States.

With the help of his student and hitman, Obake, he steals the technology to allow him to travel through time. Taking with him Obake and his cybernetic assassin, Dallas 13, he makes the jump back to 1970s to cripple the United States and bring OMAR to total domination.

Appearing in 1970s, the three vehicles encounter Convoy, the former leader of the Vigilantes. Upon seeing him, the three cars open fire.
[edit] Gameplay

The purpose of the game is to control a vehicle and eliminate all other vehicles in the arena with the use of weapons and upgrades. The player can choose to play through a story mode, Quest Mode, or play with an assorted number of bots, players choice, in Arcade mode. Second Offense introduced the Salvage points system, which allows the player to upgrade their vehicle by collecting "Salvage Points" from destroyed opponents.

Description

Transform your N64 into a powerful chess adversary. The most awesome chess engine adapts to any skill level. Learning is endless fun yet even superb players face the maximum challenge. Brilliant graphics brings this classic game alive. Become the next chess legend!

Features

Virtual Chess 64 came with a basic text and visual tutorial written for beginners and novices about how to play chess. In the third section the tutorial continues explaining how to play using simple chess positions in which you learn from by finding the best move each time. The short fourth section is analysis of two badly played well-known games titled "Fool's Mate" and "Scholar's Checkmate". In the fifth and sixth sections these chess problems become increasingly complicated, and the player is expected to, by some means, find the solution and understand it. The seventh section is about basic endgame checkmating approaches and patterns, and just one basic endgame concept for beginners: the square of the promoting pawn. The last three sections focus on improving opening, middlegame, and endgame chess play by using example games for analysis.

The tutorial does not extend enough to teach how to win a game against the chess engine featured in this game, but it is enough to inspire some to learn more through other sources. The only spoken part of the tutorial are the comments on the chosen correct moves listed (below) in order of first-to-last spoken as you answer tutorial challenges. (In a few cases the comment is randomly chosen, so the order is approximate.)

    * "Well Done!"
    * "Great!"
    * "Brilliant!"
    * "Wonderful!"
    * "Fantastic!"

In disregard to the unrecorded completion of the tutorial you could play a full game yourself using either a 2D or 3D board. There was a "Rotate Board" option for the 2D and 3D boards, although the C-left and C-right buttons could be used to rotate the 3D board by a greater variety of angle measures. On the 3D board every time a piece was captured you would have a short cut scene depicting the capture of said piece unless this is disabled or only limited to one-time only scene play per piece capture combination via configuration. The idea was to amuse the player. There were no cut scenes on the 2D board for captures, but you could change the design of the pieces and board by pressing the C-left or C-right button and use the "flash think" and last move square lights. There were four 2D chess sets to select from: standard white and black icons, arctic and jungle animals, silver and gold pieces, and heroic and demonic characters. You could also play as either white or black pieces and you could even make situations of your own by adding or removing pieces from the board and placing them in different positions, but there is a bug removing the option to castle in games starting from positions customized through this feature. Like most board games, you had the option of 2 human players instead of 1 but also the option of seeing the chess engine play itself.

The game also had a "Level" option in which you could set the time taken for the chess engine to respond based on the complexity of the position. "Beginner #1" is the top and default setting of the list, and "Level 12" is the bottom setting. Time is the only real factor behind the quality of the engine's moves, and while the default difficulty level setting resulted in analyzation in a matter of few seconds (seldom more than 10), the "Level 12" setting resulted in waiting times greatly variant based on the position. (The longest time might be no more than 30 minutes in any reachable chess position, most such instances subject to see in replay of certain correspondence chess games.) There is a "Meditation" setting by which, if enabled, the chess engine will think on your time except usually during the opening phase of the game in which predefined moves are played. Again based on the complexity of the position, analyzation will continue for a matter of hours or days until either a forced checkmate is found or you make your move.

Characters

White and Black sets have different character models.

 White

    * King
          o The king is wearing armor covering all but his face, wearing a crown, wielding a spear and shield, and riding a toy horse.
    * Queen
          o The queen is wearing a dress that covers most of her body, purple gloves, a matching backwards-facing shoe, an oversized hat pin, and a purse.
    * Rook
          o The rook is shown as a small sentient castle complete with drawbridge.
    * Bishop
          o The bishop is depicted as a stereotypical wizard. He has a tall hat, long robe, mirror, and magic staff.
    * Knight
          o The night is depicted as the mythical unicorn with a blue tail and eyes and a black mane.
    * Pawn
          o The pawn is an overweight knave. He is armed with a two pronged pitchfork, an axe, and a feather.

Black

    * King
          o The king is an overly-muscled warrior with torn brown clothes. He also has a seldom-used sword.
    * Queen
          o The queen is obese and bald except for two braids on top of her head.
    * Rook
          o The rook is a sentient catapult often hauling a rock.
    * Bishop
          o The bishop is a flying imp with the tail of a dragon. The bishop also has a mirror and a scepter.
    * Knight
          o The knight is shown as a sentient battering ram on wheels.
    * Pawn
          o The pawn is shown as a barbarian with a hammer and a less elegant two pronged pitchfork than the white pawn.

It is part of the "Virtual Pool" game franchise, which also includes the PC games Virtual Pool, Virtual Pool 2, Virtual Pool Hall and Virtual Pool 3.

Description

Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Odo Keisho was a video game released in 2000 on the Nintendo 64 game console. The game was only released in Japan and was the sequel to Virtual Pro Wrestling 64.

Just as its predecessor was considered the Japanese counterpart of WCW vs. nWo: World Tour, this game was considered the Japanese counterpart of WWF WrestleMania 2000. The difference between this and its predecessor however is the fact that none of the current WWF superstars at the time were included in this game, unlike WCW's influence in the previous title as well as the inclusion of a Mixed Martial Art rules and fighters. Of interest was the sheer number of combinations with regards to the character editor. Considered deeper than the WWF/WCW N64 games, VPW 2 also had over 200 moves and throws. The MMA style also allowed a "combo" move set in which the player could mix in different strikes and throws. Pro wrestler A.J. Styles claimed this game to be the "best wrestling game ever made".

Description

Billions of years ago, a Being from a distant galaxy was transporting a precious cargo of life giving Ore. The turbulent formation of our solar system caused his ship to crash, scattering Ore over the molten surface of Planet Earth. Through the millennia, Ten Humans came into contact with the Ore and were transformed into super-evolved warriors. These are the WarGods.

Characters

    * Warhead (Radioactive American soldier with missiles)
    * Kabuki Jo (Japanese Kabuki warrior)
    * CY-5 (Cyborg)
    * Tak (Living tribal statue)
    * Pagan (A pagan witch)
    * Vallah (A Norse Valkyrie)
    * Maximus (A gladiator)
    * Ahau Kin (Aztec/Mayan Priest)
    * Voodoo (Witch doctor)
    * Anubis (A grave robber turned god of the dead)
    * Grox (Sub-boss: A massive frog-like monster)
    * Exor (Boss: Seen on the game's box art)

Background

War Gods was developed by a team led by George Petro (lead programmer) and Jack Haeger (lead artist). It was very similar to Midway's more famous Mortal Kombat series in featuring a great deal of gore and horrific fatalities. The array of playable characters featured gods (or, more accurately, immortals). One featured character in the game was Anubis, the Ancient Egyptian guardian of the underworld, and the Jackal God. Other characters were more reminiscent of Roman gladiators such as "Maximus", the houngan "Voodoo", the questionable Kabuki Jo and the obviously fictional cybernetic "CY-5".

Released by Midway as a sort of litmus test of its new 3D software prior to the release of Mortal Kombat 4, War Gods was not a big financial success. The game was frowned upon by critics for the clumsy use of human models in its character design.

Character backgrounds

AHAU KIN: In a vision, AHAU KIN, an evil high priest, learned that untold power lay at the bottom of his tribe's sacrificial well. One by one, he sent his slaves to their death diving to reach The Ore. Finally, overwhelmed with desire, he plunged to the well's depths and retrieved The Ore.

ANUBIS: While searching for lost treasure in the Valley of the Kings, a grave robber uncovered a hidden burial chamber. The thief tried to steal its treasures, unaware that The Ore had been placed in the chamber to destroy anyone who entered. His body was destroyed by The Ore, but his soul is cursed to return as ANUBIS.

CY-5: The power of The Ore is timeless. In the year 2096, scientists will implant The Ore into CY-5, an advanced cyborg, unaware that The Ore has life-giving power. CY-5 will kill the scientists. It will conclude that more Ore is needed for greater human consciousness. CY-5 will fight in a ruthless systematic manner to achieve its goal...

KABUKI JO: A feared medieval samurai discovered The Ore on the eve of a great battle. Overwhelmed by its power, he slaughtered his men in a rage of fire and fury. Shamed by the destruction he had caused, he became KABUKI JO, an outcast determined to master the power that consumes him.

MAXIMUS: MAXIMUS, a mighty gladiator, fought for the entertainment of his masters. During a great festival that celebrated The Ore, he battled to determine which of his masters would possess it. He killed his opponent, but slaughtered his masters as well. He took The Ore and escaped. Consumed by its power, he fights for all who have been enslaved.

PAGAN: Ancient manuscripts revealed the location of The Ore to PAGAN, a mistress of the black arts. She arrived at the ruins of a cathedral where The Ore was once worshipped. Pagan summoned forth the hidden Ore by reciting the manuscript's incantations. The Ore increased her hunger for power and destruction. She will destroy anyone who stands in her way.

TAK: Thousands of years ago, a kingdom worshipped The Ore as a god. A rival kingdom declared war to capture The Ore. In the face of defeat, the king hid The Ore in a stone idol. The idol came to life as TAK, avenger of a lost civilization.

VALLAH: VALLAH, a warrior princess, became separated from battle during a great ice storm. Taking shelter in a nearby cave, she saw a glowing green light trapped inside a translucent wall of ice. Hacking away at the ice, her sword finally made contact with The Ore. Vallah was transformed into a Viking goddess, and rules the realm of ice.

VOODOO: In a Caribbean village, a witch doctor enslaved his people with black magic and arcane spells. One night in desperation, the villagers captured the witch doctor and burnt him to death. They threw his body into a forbidden swamp, unaware that it hid a deposit of The Ore. The ore's energy brought his corpse back to life as VOODOO, god of the undead.

WARHEAD: Government officials were worried than an experiment to merge nuclear weapons with The Ore was in jeopardy. They sent their top operative to investigate. When he arrived at the research center, the building exploded, covering his body with fragments of The Ore. The soldier was transformed into WARHEAD, a super-human fighter.

Wave Race 64
Platform: Nintendo 64

Developer: Nintendo EAD

Description

Wave Race 64 is sure to provide some of the most exciting racing you've ever experienced. Feel the pounding and crashing of the waves as you accelerate into straight-aways, whip around the marker buoys and go airborne on the jump ramps. Don't race alone - challenge a friend! Take control in three different modes of play - Championship, Time Trials and Stunt Mode. Nine challenging courses set in exotic locales - race conditions change and the wave action responds to the way both you and your opponents race!

Gameplay

The objective of each race is to not only to beat the other racers but also to successfully weave the jet-ski through various buoys. There are two types of buoys: red colored, which are signified by an R on them and must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which are marked with an L and must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow will light and the jet-ski will gain speed. Up to five arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power.

Failure to do either of these will result in a loss of power (though the arrows can be lit again) and missing five buoys over the course of a race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course (either by leaving the area limited by pink buoys or by leaving the water altogether) for more than ten seconds will also result in disqualification.


Game modes

The game modes are:

    * Championship: the player must beat a series of tracks and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, Expert and Reverse (the last being basically Expert with the tracks oriented backwards). Hard, Expert, and Reverse initially need to be unlocked. Also, the difficulty determines the number of courses played (six in Normal, seven in Hard and eight in Expert/Reverse). Each track has a specific set of points that the player must achieve in order to move to the next track. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over. The ranking the player finishes each race in determines the amount of points given: first place receives 7 points, second place receives 4 points, and third and fourth places receive 2 and 1 points, respectively. Players who are disqualified during the race do not receive any points.

    * Warm Up: In this mode, the player trains to use the jet-ski in a special course known as Dolphin Park. In the bottom of the screen a prompt will indicate a set of instructions to control the vehicle, though the player can ignore it and practice by him- or herself. The player can also start Championship mode from Dolphin Park if they decide to.

    * Time Trials: the typical time-attack mode in order to perform the best times, which are recorded in the game's data. Only the courses that have been unlocked can be played.

    * Stunt Mode: In this mode the player plays solo in order to earn points by executing stunts and passing through hoops. The points depend upon how many hoops the player passes through without missing, as well as the class of stunt that has been performed, in which conditions it was executed, and the frequency that particular stunt has been done (the more times a single stunt is successfully completed, the amount of points awarded decreases). The game keeps track of the best scores. Only the unlocked courses can be played, and the warm up level, Dolphin Park, is also available.

    * 2P VS.: A versus mode with a second player. The screen is vertically divided into two sections by a horizontal line. Like in other modes, only the unlocked tracks can be played.

The options menu allows the player to check audio, look over and erase records, and manage saved data from either the game itself or the Controller Pak. The names of the characters and the racing conditions (required laps, wave conditions, etc.) can also be changed.

Wave Race 64 Shindou Edition
Platform: Nintendo 64

Developer: Nintendo EAD

*
Shindou Wave Race 64 is essentially the same game as the original Wave Race 64 but with added Rumble Pak support. Stunt modes, race meets, two-player versus games, and time trial modes are all present. A total of nine courses are available to race through or, in the case of the stunt modes, show off. An integral aspect of Wave Race is that movements of both the tide and waves affect gameplay. The control system hinges on use of the analog Control Stick, which can be used to perform tricks in addition to steering the craft.

As with Shindou Super Mario 64, Shindou Wave Race 64 is a special edition Japan-only release that has a few cosmetic enhancements. For starters, sections of the soundtrack have been raised a couple of keys. There is also a Rumble Pak logo in the corner of the screen, which shakes whenever the feature is activated. The announcer has also changed his inflection on some of the comments, and other sound effects have been adjusted to match the soundtrack changes. Alterations to the game's packaging and cartridge label design are also notable.

Description

Tear up the ice with "The Great One", and experience lightning-fast skating, blistering one-timers and hard-hitting body checks! Hammer the puck and rip the net... with the world's best! NHLPA and NHL license means real players, team names, logos, and uniforms. Includes all 26 teams, each with 17 available players in their actual NHL lines. Real-time rendered 3D environment with 7 user-selectable cameras allowing players to view the action from all possible angles. Wayne's hockey strategies, skating moves and logic are incorporated into the AI engine.

Info

Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey is a video game developed by Atari Games[1] and released for the arcade in 1996. It was later ported to the Nintendo 64 console on October 31, 1996, where it was the first-ever 4-player game for the Nintendo 64. The game was subsequently re-released as Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 (also ported to the PlayStation) and later in an Olympic version. The players are polygonal, not sprites.

As opposed to the more realistic hockey gameplay seen in Electronic Arts' NHL series, the game featured a more unrealistic arcade-style of gameplay, featuring moves such as "power saves", which caused the goaltender to briefly transform into a brick wall, "power shots", which would set the net on fire or knock the goalie into the net, and "power checks", which would send an ambulance across the top of the screen. It featured high-scoring games and over-the-top fights.

There was also a simulation mode for those looking for more realistic gameplay. The game allowed the creation of profiles and would keep track of important individual and team stats, including goals, assists, and wins, among others.

Description

Take on "The Great One" again in this hot sequel to the smash hit voted "Best Sports Game" of '96! With more great features, such as new hidden teams and improved, hard-hitting AI, Gretzky '98 packs a wallop! Includes all 26 teams, each with 17 available players on their actual NHL teams, and you can make player trades or line manipulations to create a powerhouse team of your own. Play 3-on-3, 4-on-4 or 5-on-5 games on either arcade or regulation size hockey rinks, plus exhibition games, full 82 game seasons or a best-of-seven playoff series with full statistic saving capability.


Gameplay

Gameplay consists of two basic options: Arcade and Simulation. Although the graphics and earlobe vary little between the two, other changes have the effect of changing the chemistry and intensity of gameplay between the two options. The gamer has the ability to customize period length, fatigue (on/off), line changes, fighting (on/off), penalties (simulation only), rink size (arcade only), puck-streak (on/off), and camera angle.

    * Simulation Mode

Simulation mode is designed to emulate the real game of hockey. Players may play five, four, or three to a side, depending on preference. Recognition of penalties, off-sides, and icing are all optional, but two-line pass is not considered. Period length can be selected between 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.

    * Arcade Mode

During the Arcade mode checking, hooking, and tripping are more violent. Fights occur with greater frequency, and penalties are disregarded entirely. Additionally, arcade mode sees the introduction of a "power shot", which a player may utilize to light the net on fire after a goal. Arcade mode tends to be more exciting.


Trivia

The game gained widespread criticism for several perceived shortcomings. The game was perceived to be crude and unfitting as a pure hockey simulator, leaving many enthusiasts disappointed, but many arcade fans delighted.

No-Holds-Barred Brawling! Over 50 WCW superstars, including the women of the WCW! 14 playable Backstage Areas, including the new Semi-Trailer Area. Destroy your enemy faster with power-ups! New - First Blood Mode and Torch matches! Use your environment as a weapon!

Overview

Backstage Assault is vastly different from other games of its genre. Any wrestling game prior to it that featured backstage areas (such as the SmackDown! series or its predecessor, WCW Mayhem) treated them as auxiliary fighting locations. Backstage Assault took the concept further by removing the ring entirely and having all action take place backstage.

Hardcore Challenge

Hardcore Challenge is Backstage Assault's primary gameplay mode. It consists of winning matches against random opponents until challenged by the champion. Throughout the game, players can unlock wrestlers, arenas, and moves for use in Create-a-Superstar. The player cannot defend the championship after earning it.

Info

It was the final World Championship Wrestling game to be released before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation. The game features commentary by Tony Schiavone and Bobby "The Brain" Heenan. To date, the game has sold only 200,000 copies.

WCW Mayhem is a professional wrestling video game by Electronic Arts, which shares its name with a World Championship Wrestling pay-per-view event. It was released for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in 1999 and for Game Boy Color the following year.

The game featured several firsts for a wrestling title. For instance, Mayhem was the first game to feature all twelve WCW pay-per-view venues as well as all three major WCW TV shows (Nitro, Thunder, and Saturday Night). Mayhem was also the first wrestling game released in the United States to include backstage areas, a feature which would be expanded upon in its sequel, WCW Backstage Assault. It was also one of the first wrestling games to integrate audio commentary provided by Bobby Heenan and Tony Schiavone; although, only Schiavone was included in the N64 version despite some of his lines being addressed directly to Heenan. The game was also originally going to be the first story-based wrestling video game. This idea, however, was later abandoned due to time restraints.

Mayhem also featured a Pay-Per-View mode which was unique from other wrestling games, in that the player could enter a code to unlock real-life pay-per-view match lineups; these codes would be given on Monday Nitro broadcasts the week before a pay-per-view. However, this only lasted for about 3 months, as the games' roster was outdated soon after its release, with several of the featured wrestlers leaving the company. The game was partially sponsored by Surge soft drinks at the time of game release.


Background

Mayhem's working title was WCW/nWo Mayhem, as evidenced by early photographs featuring wrestlers wearing shirts with an older Mayhem logo. The game was promoted for months on WCW TV, including a counter which appeared on programs such as Monday Nitro and Thunder, counting down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds to Mayhem's release on August 31, 1999. A clip was even shown of Goldberg's character in a house environment spearing someone through a wall but the move and the house area were not seen in the final game.

A sequel to this game, tentatively titled WCW Mayhem 2 was planned for release on the PlayStation 2 in 2001. The game was slated to be developed by Aki Corporation, the developers of acclaimed WCW and WWF titles for the Nintendo 64.[1] However, due to WCW being purchased by the WWF, the game's development was canceled. Aki would instead develop Def Jam Vendetta for the next generation of consoles. Work on WCW Mayhem 2 began mainly in response to the failure of WCW Backstage Assault.


Reception

Upon its release the game got above average reviews.[2] However, critics did cite the game for its poor collision detection and lack of diverse movesets. Rotten Tomatoes gives WCW Mayhem a 58%, and Metacritic gives the game a 60 out of 100 reviews, which are average ratings. In addition, many[who?] felt the much-touted create-a-wrestler mode was below average. The commentary has been praised as being one of the best wrestling games to feature commentary, and has been said to have been absolutely better than the WWE games' commentary.

WCW vs. nWo - World Tour
Platform: Nintendo 64
Region: USA
Media: Cartridge
Controller: Rumble Pak
Genre: VS Fighter > Wrestling
Release Year: 1997
Developer: Asmik Ace Entertainment/Aki Corporation
Publisher: THQ
Players: 1 to 4 VS; Co-Op

Description

Over 40 wrestlers in all, including over 20 WCW and NWO superstars like Hollywood Hogan, Sting, The Giant, Lex Luger, Ric Flair, The Outsiders, and many more! Each wrestler is capable of performing 30 to 40 moves, including his own signature moves! Featuring five different gameplay modes, and Tag Team and simultaneous four-player action!

Info

The game was THQ's first foray into the Nintendo 64 wrestling scene and is a semi sequel to the lesser known WCW vs. The World for the PlayStation. In the beginning, Asmik Ace and AKI began producing a wrestling game that was similar to Puroresu and fighting games for WCW. The game was very well received due to its tight construction and ease of play, especially compared to Acclaim's comparatively more difficult and convoluted game, WWF War Zone.

Gameplay

The game introduced Asmik/AKI's critically acclaimed grappling system, in which all moves are started by holds. Choosing to either tap or hold the A button will subsequently produce either "weak" or strong results once the move is performed, while a similar system is used for strikes. Wrestlers can also perform taunts to help elevate their Spirit gauge and perform "Special" front and rear grapple moves when their gauge peaks.

In addition to single, tag team, handicap, and battle royal, match modes not seen in future releases include a WCW versus nWo tournament, round-robin tournament, and league tournaments more familiar to Japanese wrestling. Unlike today's wrestling games, World Tour features no create-a-wrestler mode, no story mode, no ring entrances, and has a limited amount of actual WCW wrestlers. It also makes no reference to championship belts and, upon the successful completion of a tournament, shows an illustration of a fist raising a gold trophy.

Asmik Ace and THQ did include a number of "fictional" characters in the game, who are actually Japanese wrestlers that appeared in that country's version of the game, Virtual Pro Wrestling 64. They appear in the American version with names changed due to copyright laws. These Japanese wrestlers include, among others FMW stars such as Hayabusa, who was renamed "Hannibal," and Atsushi Onita, who was renamed "Puchtecha," as well as future WWF stars such as Taka Michinoku, who went by the moniker of "Black Belt." These characters were also given extravagant profiles in the game's official strategy guide (Abdullah the Butcher, renamed "Saladin," is described as a former Afghan Secret service operative who refused orders to assassinate Mikhail Gorbachev).[1] The player can also enable bleeding despite the practice being forbidden in WCW at the time due to its more family-friendly presentation.

The sequel to World Tour, WCW/nWo Revenge, would continue the success of its predecessor. Revenge built upon the engine tremendously by introducing ring entrances, improved graphics, more arenas, more signature moves, actual WCW championships, attire modification, and other improvements.

Info

It is the sequel to 1997's WCW vs. nWo: World Tour. Like its predecessor, Revenge features AKI's revolutionary grappling system, heavily improved graphics, a championship mode, and a large roster of wrestlers (real and fictional). To date, the game has sold over 3 million copies, and is often considered one of the best multi player fighting games of all-time.

History

At the time of the game's release, the Monday Night Wars were starting to go in the WWF's favor. Despite this WCW/nWo Revenge was generally recognized as the best wrestling game of 1998. It also was voted best WCW/nWo game of all time.

Revenge's main competition that year was WWF War Zone by Acclaim. In contrast to the simpler but more consistent visuals and accessible but slower play mechanics of Revenge, War Zone possesses more complicated controls, inconsistent collision detection, a lack of impact on grappling moves and occasionally awkward animations, despite having more refined character models and faster gameplay.

The Revenge grappling system is part of what ensured the game's success and popularity. The system was simple to learn, but also featured a variety of moves that could be performed depending on the character. The graphics were improved from World Tour, and for the first time, THQ introduced actual arenas into games, such as Monday Nitro, Starrcade, Bash at the Beach, Souled Out, SuperBrawl, and Halloween Havoc. The game also has an expansive collection of wrestlers, as almost every WCW/nWo wrestler of the time was included in the game. The Championship Mode enables the player(s) to select a belt and then fight various wrestlers until eventually the player(s) defeat the reigning champion.

Featured wrestlers

Revenge features about 63 WCW and nWo wrestlers divided into either factions (nWo White, nWo Red, Raven's Flock) or divisions within WCW (WCW 1-4). Generally speaking, wrestlers were placed in the WCW divisions based on their position in the company, with top-tier main eventers making up WCW 1, the mid-card wrestlers in WCW 2, and low-card wrestlers forming WCW 3. WCW 4 is reserved for cruiserweights. Note that WCW 1-4 are not actual factions.

Additionally, Revenge features several non-WCW/nWo wrestlers, mostly from Japan, in the form of two "fictitious" wrestling federations: EWF (Empire Wrestling Federation) and DAW (Dead or Alive Wrestling, originally featured in World Tour as DOA). In light of copyright concerns, the names and appearances of these wrestlers were changed, but their movesets remained intact.

Description

A rainstorm so fierce, it will keep you from leaving your home for the next six months. Wetrix just might be the most addictive puzzle game of all time. Using randomly shaped 3D blocks as they fall from the sky, you must create a series of lakes and dams before the heavy rains appear. Because if the water drains, you lose! Sound simple? Well, mix in a few natural disasters and bomb attacks, and suddenly you need to muster all your strategy and skill to combat nature's fury!

Gameplay

In the classic mode, you start out with a flat piece of land; the ultimate goal being to gain as many points as possible, managing a landscape of lakes and ponds. This is accomplished by maneuvering different types of random pieces that fall onto the playing area, one at a time (much like the puzzle game Tetris). These pieces each have differing effects upon the arena, but the standard pieces are uppers, which increase the land level by one tier, and fall in different shapes. These can be used to sculpt walls and dams, and the perimeters of lakes. Shortly into the game, water bubble pieces will begin to fall, which burst upon impact with the land, and flow realistically like a fluid across the landscape. The main method of gathering points is by using the fireball piece to evaporate lakes, the amount of points depending upon the volume of water. On the right side of the screen is a water gauge, which fills up as water falls off the edge of the landscape, or down holes created by bombs. The player loses the game when the gauge fills up to the top. The only way to reduce the level of the water gauge is by evaporating water with fireballs, again the amount it is reduced by depends on the amount of water evaporated.


Pieces

The following game pieces are used:

Uppers 
    Increase the land level by one unit where the piece hits.
Downers 
    Decrease the land level that the piece covers, uniformly to the lowest level of land that the piece hits.
Water 
    Bubbles of water that burst upon contact with land.
Fireball 
    Evaporates water for points, and can decrease the drain's water level.
Bomb 
    Creates holes upon impact with the land, which water can fall through. Use uppers to repair holes (results in a repair bonus). Drop a bomb in a hole and a "rebomb" occurs, in which three other bombs fall, out of control, across the landscape.
Smart bomb 
    Not strictly a piece, smart bombs, once collected, can be used at any time with the Z or L buttons. One is awarded to the player if they gain levels whilst the landscape has 5 lakes or higher. In using one, the landscape is reduced to flatness and the earthquake and water gauges are reset to zero, effectively giving the player a fresh start (the only exemption being the level, and as an effect, the speed of the falling pieces). 


Rainbows and ducks

Getting ducks and rainbows in the game are one of the goals of the player, and aid in the attainment of more points, by multiplying the amount gained when a lake is bombarded by fireballs. A rainbow is created when the total volume of water in the player's landscape passes a certain limit, and effects a Rainbow Multiplier that causes all scores obtained (via evaporation and Repair Bonuses) while the rainbow exists by 10. Once the total volume of water passes back below the limit, the rainbow disappears.

Rubber Duckys [sic] appear in deep bodies of water, specifically around two blocks high, and multiply all scores on the landscape by two whilst the water remains that high. There is no particular limit to how large the lake must or can be, and the effects of multiple Duckys can be stacked. From a strategic point of view, it is implied that smaller duck lakes are preferable, as they conserve space on the playing area, and less land (Uppers) used to build them minimises the Earthquake gauge. For high scores, having over six ducks is important

Earthquakes

As each upper falls upon the landscape, the earthquake gauge on the left hand side of the screen begins to fill up. The gauge is a direct representation of how much extra land has been added to the landscape. When the gauge fills up completely, an "earthquake" event occurs, which drastically warps the playing area and chaotically rearranges the landscape. Generally an earthquake leads to either game over (water leaking over the edges in the aftermath) or an extremely difficult road towards recreating the landscape. As a result, earthquakes are obviously to be avoided at any cost. Prevention techniques include strategic use of downers to 'trim' the landscape (keeping it even and making sure that the walls are to only as high as they need be), and the creation of a safe area for bombs, where unneeded uppers can be placed and then destroyed. Additionally, fireballs can also destroy land in the same way as bombs, the major difference lying in the fact that they do not create holes in the landscape.

Modes

Practice
    A series of lessons or practice play. The lessons teach you how everything in the game works, including the different pieces to making rainbows. Practice play is a lot like classic mode, but it differs in the fact that the blocks will never fall until you drop them and you start with 9 smart bombs. Also, most bonuses, like ducks and rainbows, are disabled.
Classic
    You start at level one and face the normal hazards like rain, ice and mines. Pieces will fall at a rate related to the level.
Pro
    You start on level five (but looks like level 7) and these pieces fall faster. Also, some pieces have different formations or are doubled (i.e. all bombs fall in pairs).
Challenge
    You have to try to survive the special setting. Here's the list of the challenges:

        1 Minute: You have 1 minute and start at level 10.
        5 Minute: You have 5 minutes and start at level 5.
        100 Pieces: Only 100 pieces will fall and start at level 8.
        500 Pieces: Only 500 pieces will fall and start at level 4.
        Preset A: The pieces fall according to a preset sequence and start at level 1.
        Preset B: Like Preset A, but the sequence is not the same and you start at level 6.

Handicapped
    Like Classic but with a specific handicap. The possible handicaps are the following:

        Raised Land A: Your earthquake meter is already a little filled when you start.
        Raised Land B: Your earthquake meter starts even more filled.
        Ice Layer A: You start with spots of ice on the floor. Upon level up, all the water on the board will vanish, and the original ice layer will reappear.
        Ice Layer B: Like Ice Layer A but a different ice pattern. Upon level up, all the water on the board will vanish, and the original ice layer will reappear.
        Random Land: You start with a randomly raised floor. Upon level up, the surface will reset to a random pattern, almost effectively starting the game over with another randomized surface.
        Random Holes: You start with a randomly holed floor. Upon level up, holes will appear in random spots, and all water on the board will vanish. You will also be given a set of uppers, similar to game start.
        Half-Full drain: Start with the drain half-filled. Upon level up, the drain will be reset to half-full.

Multiplayer
    Puts two players against each other, the goal is to survive. You gain powers to throw at the other player by evaporating lakes, ranging from: water, ice, earthquake and bomb.

Description

The first blast wiped out your Space Center. In just 3 hours, the hi-tech weapons satellite will strike again... It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen. Featuring intense third-person shooting action, precision laser-sighting aiming mechanism, immense 3D environments, battle heavily-armed boss characters and "smart" enemies, 4-player Deathmatch, along with Lethal Tag, Cube Hunt, and Quick Draw.


Story

In the beginning, an armed group takes control of a space based laser weapon. This is used to attack a military installation housing the controls to the weapon, called the GULF system. The leader of the terrorists calls himself Colonel Kenneth Coleman and he is the leader of The Crying Lions. The Secretary of Defense contacts the Special Covert Action Team (SCAT) with their orders: Enter the GULF complex and reclaim it. Jean-Luc Cougar is part of the team in a helicopter that is soon shot down. One by one most of the team escapes the helicopter. The player takes control of Jean-Luc as he leaps a wall and enters a parking lot. The team is scattered and you must find them and destroy the satellite's control center. You must also race against the clock and the ever increasing body count of your own friends, as they are being killed off one by one. Along the way you will face a number of laser traps, puzzles, machine gun nests, ambushes and mazes. You will face sub bosses culminating in a semi final boss fight. The ending varies, depending on how much time it took to make it through the game. In a separate game mode, you can fight the sub bosses to unlock them as multiplayer characters.

There are three possible Endings:

Good Ending: Upon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc encounters Dan. Jean discovers Dan's reasons for his betrayal of the team and the deaths of your comrades. It turns out that he was half Saroczian and at the age of 13, war broke out in the country. Splitting his family in two, his mother and sister defected to Russia while his brother and father joined the Saroczian Revolution. Several years later after the separation, he joins the Army and was eventually sent on a mission by the US Forces to keep the government in power by quashing the revolution supported by a majority of the people. The mission was carried out but Dan was filled with regrets which he says fate was responsible for. He also met his brother, Kenneth Coleman, the same man who is the leader of the Crying Lions and fought to end the suffering of the Saroczian people and avenge his father's death. Cecile fights one last battle against Jean-Luc and is defeated while Lisa comes to discover that Cecil is dead. In one last decision. The GULF satellite was destroyed as Keith, Lisa and Jean-Luc extracts with Operation Winback being a success.

Bad and Worse Ending: Upon reaching the satellite control room, Jean-Luc finds Lisa and Jake dead and Cecile waiting for him. He begins one final duel with him with Jean-Luc being victorious. However just as he about to kill Cecile, he orders the satellite to fire, destroying the Pentagon and White house. With Jean-Luc being the only survivor of the conflict, Operation Winback was a failure.


Characters
S.C.A.T. Members

JEAN-LUC COUGAR: Jean-Luc is a former member of a city SWAT team, 27 years old and single. His ability to remain levelheaded in even the most harrowing situations gained him a spot as the leader of the Advance Strike Team of S.C.A.T. He is highly respected by the younger teammates (most likely an NCO or basically a go-between officers and non-officers), and finds it easier to express his fighting spirit in actions rather than words. His handgun is the last reminder he has of his older brother Alan, a member of the Army Special Forces who was lost in battle and is presumed dead.

LISA ROBERTS: The only female member. Her grandmother was Japanese, and Lisa claims to possess a strong fighting spirit. After acing her courses on criminal psychology at the university, she went to join the National Bureau of Investigation. She is also an excellent long-range sharp shooter, and was once offered to test her skills in the Olympics. Dan offered her a position in S.C.A.T. after seeing her in action during a training session at the NBI academy. Survived mission.

DANIEL STEWART: S.C.A.T.'s first and only commander. His experience and leadership help hold together the various personalities that make up S.C.A.T. He is also a former member of the Army Special Forces and a trusted friend of Jean-Luc's brother Alan. He was the one that killed Tom and Steve.

LAW BRUFORD: 6'6" 250 lbs of pure fighting machine. He was transferred to S.C.A.T. from the Marine Corps Recon Battalions on the recommendation of his commanding officer. He is unmatched in hand to hand combat, and was Jean-Luc's toughest competition for Leader of the Advance Strike Team. Gunned down by Cecile.

JAKE HUDSON: A former Special Forces grunt, Jake joined at the same time as Jean-Luc. He is somewhat of a prankster and loves to pick on Lisa whenever he gets a chance. He is as brave as they come, and his shooting ability is questioned by none. Gunned down by Cecil and Deathmask while attempting to rescue Lisa and Jean-Luc.

MICHAEL HAWKINS: A demotions expert and former member of the National Drug Enforcement Agency's bomb squad. His skills in defusing bombs and destroying obstructions make him a key player in the fight against terrorism. Shot by Banderas.

THOMAS SMITH: He is in charge of all communications for the backup support team. A former member of the computer crime division in the National Bureau of Investigation, he is well versed in all facets of computers and other high tech electronics. He is the second team member killed.

STEVEN LEGAL: As Second-in-Command of S.C.A.T. he received most of his training in the British Special Air Service and MI6. His information gathering and keen analytical skills make him the top choice for any scouting mission. He was also the instructor and drill sergeant for incoming S.C.A.T. Members, and trained Jean-Luc Cougar. He is Gunned down by Dan.

KEITH BIRDY: No team would be complete without a support member trained in medicine. As the rookie of the team, Keith joined S.C.A.T. with the highest recommendations from the President. The GULF mission is his first with the group. He survived the mission, but was injured by Duke.

MATTHEW BROWN: Very little is known about him other than the African-American who planned to get back in church after the mission. Clips shown of him in the team section as being a great expert in hand to hand combat, possibly being the second best on the team. He is shot in the head by Cecile Carlyle of the Crying Lions very early in the mission, making him the first member to be killed.
[edit] The Crying Lions

Made up of remnants of the former Saroczian Special Forces, the unit adopted this moniker when they invaded the GULF complex in 2001. They were highly trained and well equipped, but had limited combat experience, with the exception of their leading officers. According to the official report, all the members were killed during the GULF incident, though many mercenaries throughout the world dispute by claiming to have once been a member of the Crying Lions.

"Kenneth Coleman": The leader of the Crying Lions. Born in Rhodesia, he became a mercenary after serving in the Selous Scouts and the C Squadron 22 (Rhodesian) SAS. Fighting in many conflicts across the globe, Coleman was contracted to form the Saroczian Special Forces just before the US invasion. He was killed by Cecile Carlyle, second-in-command of the Crying Lions.

Info

Winback (known as Operation: Winback in Australia and Europe) is a video game developed by Koei for the Nintendo 64 in 1999 and PlayStation 2 in 2001. A sequel, WinBack 2: Project Poseidon, produced by Cavia Inc. for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox game consoles, was released on April 25, 2006.

The story follows one Jean-Luc Cougar, a secret agent infiltrating a laser satellite's command center. Gameplay revolves around a cover system, taking cover behind corners and then ducking out to shoot.[1] The player cannot move while shooting; instead, the control stick is used to aim, a task made easier by the fact that every weapon is equipped with a laser sight.

Description

The fastest races. The deadliest weapons. The biggest name in anti-gravity racing descends on N64 with incredible new visual power and fully enhanced gameplay glory. With blistering races, challenges, time trials and a multiplay league, Wipeout 64 delivers pure racing devastation. Faster than you can imagine.


Gameplay

Wipeout 64 provides exactly the same weapons as Wipeout 2097 - down to the fact that craft fire three rockets at a time, and missiles can rear-lock - using the same symbols to represent them. The exception being the Plasma Bolt which is incorporated into a new scheme of craft-specific Super Weapons (it becomes the Energy Sphere, exclusive to Auricom). These introduced devices such as cloaks and energy drains are later made fully available in Wipeout 3. Available in this Wipeout version is an unlockable weapon power-up called the "Cyclone". This power-up strengthens your weapons. There is also the inclusion of an elimination counter that gauges how many opponents were eliminated in a race by the player. This is what paved the way for the Eliminator mode introduced in Wipeout 3.

Most of the tracks in Wipeout 64 feature mirrored layouts of circuits from select tracks in Wipeout and Wipeout 2097, set in different locations. Some conversions are not perfectly accurate, as some corners were eased or cut entirely, elevations were changed, and there were no split track sections. The only truly original circuit is the hidden Velocitar track, obtained by completing all 6 Race Challenges

Wonder Project J2: Koruro no Mori no Josette (¥ï¥ó¥À©`¥×¥í¥¸¥§¥¯¥È J2 ¥³¥ë¥í¤ÎÉ­¤Î¥¸¥ç¥¼¥Ã¥È?, lit. "Wonder Project J2: Josette of the Corlo Forest") is a Japan-exclusive Bish¨­jo and raising simulation game developed by Enix for the Nintendo 64 in 1996. It is the sequel to Wonder Project J: Kikai no Sh¨­nen P¨©no. It was one of the earliest available games for the Nintendo 64 in Japan, and was packaged with a game themed Controller Pak.

English translation

Wonder Project J2 was a Japanese-only release, and never intended for any other localization. However, some interest was sparked in North America about the game by a two page article within Nintendo Power Volume #96 (May 1997) called Epic Center which featured Wonder Project J2 as one of it last publications before it was discontinued by a lack of role-playing games on the Nintendo 64.[1]. Ten years later in 2007, an English fan translation was undertaken by translator and programmer Ryu, and made public in the form of a patch to be used on a ROM image of Wonder Project J2 for Nintendo 64 emulation on a Windows PC. The translation project has been 100% completed.

The version 1.0 translation patch can be downloaded at Ryu's website. http://www.seiyuu.info/wpj2/


Story and gameplay

Though Wonder Project J2 is a sequel to Wonder Project J, it is not necessary to have played it to understand what is going on, even though several previous characters come back. This time, the game's protagonist is a girl Gijin (robot), named Josette, invented by the same Doctor Geppetto who built Pino 15 years prior. Having just completed building Josette, the aged Doctor Geppetto had little time left to raise her on his own. This is where the player comes in to assist.

Wonder Project J2 begins with the previous game's antagonist, Messala, receiving orders from the Siliconian King, Siliconian XIII, to "find the girl who lives on the island of Corlo who is in possession of the J," an object of great power capable of giving Gijin humanity and making highly desired dreams come true. Siliconian armies are dispatched to find the girl at Corlo Island.

Our first view of Josette comes of her playing the ocarina she wears around her neck in the beautiful Corlo Forest. Her small robot bird-like companion, named Bird, comes to tell Josette that the Doctor wants to see her right away back home. There, he reveals to her that she must leave the island right away, to head to the island of Blueland where she will meet someone to help her, who exists in a world she cannot see or hear. Josette doesn't want to leave, but she is left with little choice. Doctor Geppetto dies before her in his bed, his last words wishing Josette to go lead a rich, fulfilling life. At this point, she does not yet understand the concept of death, and the passing of her creator escapes her. Nonetheless, Josette and Bird board a ship and depart for Blueland. Their departure occurring just in time, as Siliconian army planes pass over them on their way to Corlo.

Once they arrive at Blueland, they discover that it has been taken over by the Siliconian Army¡ªthough not for the reason of looking for Josette. Blueland is rich in a crystallized mineral known as Proton which is used as a fuel source in the world. Siliconian XIII ordered the exploitation of Blueland to take advantage of Proton. The inhabitants of Blueland were forced from their homes and onto an artificial floating island made of steel known as Megafloat Noah. Josette and Bird disembark at Megafloat Noah and are seen off by two of her friends from Corlo, Doro and Bou. They tell Josette that her new home will be within the Dolphin, an obsolete fishing submarine located at Dock No.2. Josette doesn't take a liking to her new surroundings, in a strange new place surrounded by people she doesn't know, who cannot know that she's a Gijin. That night, she writes a letter to Doctor Geppetto, still not understanding that he has died, explaining her situation and that she hasn't met "that person" yet, but that she's keeping her hopes high that good things will happen. The next morning she attempts to make contact with you (the player) based on what she knows.

Bird is an interfacing robot designed to help guide Josette and communicate with you. Through Bird, you inform Josette of your presence by inputting a Yes or No answer to her question about whether or not you actually exist. She becomes relieved that you do, and begins to try to get to know you from this point on. Since Josette cannot hear or see the player, she'll often ask a series of questions until she finds the right one. For example, she'll wonder if you attend a school. If you answer yes, she'll start by asking if you attend a Primary School. If you answer no, she'll continue by asking if you attend a Middle School. If you answer no again, she will ask if you attend a High School. Answering no again will lead her to ask if you attend a University. If you answer yes here, she will understand through the duration of the game that you are a university student. Her questions would then continue on to things such as "Is it fun?" Since the player can only communicate with Josette through Bird, the player has no direct control over Josette and her actions. By controlling Bird you are free to tell Josette to do specific things. However, Josette ultimately has a mind of her own and will do things around the room if left alone. She can also refuse to do things if not in a good enough mood or too tired. You must use Bird to teach Josette the things she needs to know to eventually be able to live on her own. You can answer Yes or No to her questions and approve or disapprove her actions, shaping what she knows and understands about herself, the world, and its people. You can also choose to ignore her inquiries, but advancement is not guaranteed. There are no true right or wrong answer to most of her questions and actions, as they'll get her to experience different kinds of emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, depression, annoyance, embarrassment, etc. The advancement in the game is only dependent on how well your teachings mesh with other activities on the island. If something doesn't happen right the first time, you must go back and teach Josette the right way until she understands. Thus, unlike Wonder Project J, Wonder Project J2 is not entirely linear. Once the player teaches Josette a number of fundamental achievements such as understanding Greeting people, Cleaning, Cooking, Happiness, Life and Death, Love, etc., the game will continue to its second highly plot-driven chapter. There, you will witness Josette endure through a series of hardships, and ultimately deal with the Siliconian Army in the climax of the story, all the while using the things you helped her understand.

World Cup '98 was the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997. Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, World Cup 98 was the first in the franchise to use a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version. Accurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game engine is based on that of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as ingame strategy changing and player positioning. The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals. World Cup 98 was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color.

Trivia

The World Cup Classics mode, has numerous inaccuracies in it. These include:

    * The football design, adidas Tricolor, used in reality only during the 1998 World Cup, is used in all classic matches from 1970 onwards (that is all classic mode matches shown in colour).

    * The Golden Goal rule, used in real life for the first and only time in the 1998 World Cup is used for all World Cup Classics matches in the game.

    * The penalty shootout introduced in 1970 can be used to decide any of the World Cup Classics matches in the game.

    * The Yellow and Red cards, used in real life first during the 1970 World Cup, are used for all games in this mode.

    * The cards are shown in colour during black and white/sepia matches.

    * Captions are shown in faded colour during black and white/sepia matches.

Description

Your passport to racing! Develop a racing career as you compete for job offers with each of the 15 World Driver Teams. Ten tracks located throughout the world. 20 challenging events spread across two different levels of competition. Over 30 highly detailed, exotic cars with realistic physics and handling! Race head-to-head in two-player split-screen mode. Save replay on the Controller Pak to analyze your driving skills from multiple camera angles.


One of the last racing simulations to be released for Nintendo 64, this graphically intensive title used custom microcode optimization and high polygon count modelling. The development team was able to optimize the usage of the various processors within the N64 to allow far draw distance (reducing the need for fog or pop-up), high detail texturing and models, MP3 music, Doppler effect audio, and advanced lighting and fog effects for realistic weather conditions. Impressively the game has a high resolution 640x480 mode that does not require the add-on N64 RAM Expansion Pak. Additionally, unlike many other games of its type on the platform, the game runs high resolution at a sufficiently playable pace, undoubtedly due to the use of a reduced screen area letterbox mode that lessens the number of pixels needing to be displayed.


Reviews

The game received mixed reviews due to intense competition at the time. While WDC was an improvement in nearly every way compared to Boss's similar earlier effort, Top Gear Rally, it was up against the impressive new Gran Turismo series and other new racers. Complaints included a somewhat unconvincing driving physics model, non-licensed cars, and poor sound effects and music quality. The dislike for the physics model often stems from the beginning cars being difficult to drive and offering a "sloppy" feeling of control. As the game progresses and the player receives faster and better performing cars, the game becomes easier and more enjoyable.

The soundtrack, composed of original rock & heavy metal tunes, was composed by musician Zack Ohren.

Description

'Dis ain't no fishing game. The ultimate test of strategy pits worm vs. worm throughout 44 missions for 1 - 4 players. Ignite 41 special weapons, like highly flammable old ladies, bouncy banana bombs, and flying sheep, as you inch your way to victory. Devise wickedly ingenious strategies so that your army of worms can wipe THEIR army of worms right off the planet! Over-the-top action and an endless supply of multi-player modes make Worms Armageddon the perfect strategy game!

Gameplay

Gameplay is turn-based, with each team moving in sequence (which is determined randomly) across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move one of its worms (unless the Select Worm item is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives (such as collecting a specific crate).

Each worm begins the round with a specific amount of health (which is predefined by the chosen game options or by scripting in campaign levels). When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending on the power of the weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked into the water around and below the level.

Description

WWF WARZONE is here for your N64, featuring the top superstars in the World Wrestling Federation! Signature and finishing moves unique to each wrestler. Specialized matches including Steel Cage Match. Four-player action with Tag Team, Tornado, War, and Training Modes! Over 300 motion captured maneuvers. Create and save up to 30 customized wrestlers!


Features

War Zone has many features which were unique to North American professional titles at that time. In addition to being the first 3D WWF title, the N64 version also featured high resolution 640x480 character models. The game's graphics were motion captured to reflect the unique way in which each wrestler executed his moves.

The game's momentum system is somewhat unique to the game. A character builds momentum by varying the moves he executes as well as by taunting the opponent. Repeating moves will have the crowd boo the character and give momentum to the opponent. The crowd will chant for the wrestler with maximum momentum, multiplying the damage the wrestler can do for the duration of the chant.

The game's create-a-player mode was quite popular at the time of the game's release, as it was quite extensive for a 3D game.

Each match starts with the wrestlers in the ring as the game's commentators, Vince McMahon and Jim Ross, comment on each of them (in the WWF Challenge mode, the wrestlers have brief entrances at the top of the ramp as the McMahon and Ross comment). Each wrestler has voice samples that play during each match, usually after the successful execution of a move or taunt. There are also sampled crowd chants, some of which are unique to each wrestler.

The PlayStation version also features full motion video with video clips of WWF events, as well as 3D interludes of the apocalyptic "War Zone" set once seen in the introduction of WWF's War Zone program. The game begins with a video intro of the player entering the "War Zone" and the main menu is an elevator with buttons that the player selects to access the various game modes.


Gameplay

The game's grapple system was unique at the time of the game's release. It featured punch, kick and initial grapple buttons. Grapple moves are done by performing an initial grapple and inputting a sequence of control pad presses ended by a button press. A variety of grapples moves can be done depending on the current position of the opponent.

The single player game is highlighted by the "WWF Challenge" mode - in which the player selects a character and challenges for WWF titles. The player begins on the bottom of a pyramid of television monitors with wrestler's portraits on them and works up the pyramid by winning matches against wrestlers ranked immediately above in the hierarchy (the initial rankings of these wrestlers are random). Sometimes previously defeated wrestlers will challenge the player to a "Grudge match." This is signified in the PlayStation version by a video clip of the wrestler in the War Zone issuing a challenge. These matches will usually be weapons or cage matches. If the player loses, he falls back down in ranking. As the player progresses towards the top of the pyramid, the player challenges for the Intercontinental Championship and then the WWF Championship.

At certain points in the game in the PlayStation version, the player sees clips of a groupie that either expresses interest or disinterest in the player according to whether certain matches are won or lost. After earning a spot directly under the wrestler at the top, the wrestler challenges the top wrestler for the WWF Championship. By winning the game with certain characters, the player can unlock certain special features and alternate costumes.

There are nine modes of play in total, several of which allow configurations for up to four human players. Base modes include one-on-one, tag team, cage match, weapons match, tornado tag team, war (elimination free for all), and two exclusive modes in the Nintendo 64 version; Royal Rumble and gauntlet. War Zone also includes a training mode in which the player can freely practice the moves of their chosen wrestler against a trainer in a facility resembling a gym.

Now featuring over 40 of your favorite WWF superstars! Customize your own wrestler's move sets and costumes. Over 20 game modes including all-new specialty matches. Real-life WWF entrances and theme songs. Wrestle your way to the title in an all-new career mode. First ever Create-Your-Own Pay-Per-View Mode! Two-man commentary featuring Shane McMahon and Jerry "The King" Lawler.


Gameplay

Gameplay from WWF War Zone was for the most part retained. The previous edition's "Challenge Mode" was replaced by a Career Mode which allowed a player to wrestle as a WWF star. The player would first start wrestling on house shows winning matches to work their way up to RAW, then pay-per-view events and eventually getting title shots as the Career Mode progressed. New match types were also added, including the First Blood Match.

Development

Originally, the game was to include fictional jobbers that players would face early on in the career mode. For unknown reasons, the fictional jobbers were removed from the game, but their voices, ring attire and theme songs remain accessible in the Create-a-Wrestler mode.

Though not playable in the game, The Hardy Boyz did the motion capture for the moves. The intro movie to the PlayStation version includes a dedication to Owen Hart, who died shortly before the game's release, and was posthumously included in the roster.
[edit] Reception

The game received good reviews upon release. IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 8.7 out of 10 and an 8.3 for the PlayStation version, lauding the game's many gameplay modes and customization options.[Jeff Gerstmann also lauded the game's presentation, but found fault with the game's vague play-by-play commentary. The Dreamcast version released months later was criticized for not improving much on the original versions.

WWF No Mercy

Region: USA

Controller: Controller Pak, Rumble Pak
Genre: VS Fighter > Wrestling
Release Year: 2000
Developer: Aki Corp
Publisher: THQ

Description

Jump into the ring with the biggest, baddest jambronis around and experience brutal WWF action never before seen in a console game! Over 65 WWF superstars, all-new Ladder matches, and all-new Double-Team moves, like the Dudley 3D Deathdrop! Take on the entire Federation in Survival Mode. Take the action out of the ring in 10 different backstage areas!

Gameplay

Some of the features included in WrestleMania 2000 were removed from No Mercy. First, wrestlers' entrances were cut short to showing the wrestler only appear on the stage/entrance ramp, and players never see wrestlers actually enter the ring (despite early screen shots showing full ring entrances). For example, Triple H is shown spitting water at the crowd upon entering the ring. The belt options were also changed; rather than creating a belt from scratch, players now have to complete a story mode to win a title. While this added an extra challenge to the game, fans felt that they had been robbed of a unique and well-liked option from WrestleMania 2000 (The Create-A-Belt option would return in WWE WrestleMania X8). However, the 'official' WWF belts that replaced user-created ones can still be wagered in Exhibition matches and pay-per-view events, even being used as the object in Ladder Matches. Additionally, there is noticeable slow down when four wrestlers are on the screen at once, something not present in WrestleMania 2000.

However, No Mercy features a much more extensive Create-a-Wrestler mode with more moves, more customizable body attributes, better-organized clothing options (No Mercy utilizes descriptive categories and titles for each clothing item, whereas WrestleMania 2000 simply numbers items), the ability to create female wrestlers, which is nearly impossible in WrestleMania 2000. Each wrestler in the game has four different ring attires that could be independently edited, and each attire can be completely changed including name, height and weight, body parts, and music, technically allowing four different wrestlers per slot; although, they must share a common moveset. Several of the game's unlockable wrestlers used this feature, such as Taka Michinoku who has his partner Funaki in two attire slots. The graphics also were improved significantly over the game's predecessor, and various match types made their debuts in Nintendo 64 wrestling games, including ladder matches and special referee matches. The game also marked the first time on the system in a WWF game that players could fight backstage and also the first time moves can be done on the announcer's table. Many parts of the backstage environment are usable, such as being able to hit the opponent with a pool stick and driving them through the pool table in the bar/lounge.

The story mode is more extensive, compared to WrestleMania's career mode. Each WWF title features a unique story. For the WWF Championship, players can choose any wrestler to reenact the classic feud between Mankind and Triple H that dominated the WWF in early to mid 2000. Other angles include Stone Cold Steve Austin's feud and The Rock's temporary alliance with Vince McMahon. After winning a title, the player can replay the story mode and defend the newly-acquired belt in a variety of new storylines. Also, unlike future wrestling games, players are allowed to fight for and defend any championship in the exhibition mode.

The story mode's depth is due in part to its branching storylines that develop based on the outcomes of the player's matches. In WrestleMania 2000, if the player lost a match in the career mode, the game only allowed the player to retry the match, rather than adjusting the storyline accordingly. No Mercy's story mode offers branching storylines based on the outcomes of matches. The player has to actually play through each story several times and lose matches in order to achieve a 100% completion rating.

Another notable feature that was added to the game is the "SmackDown! Mall." With money earned from winning matches in story mode and playing the Survival mode, players can purchase unlock-able characters, clothing, wrestling moves, props, tattoos, weapons, and venues.

Launch copies of No Mercy suffer from a bug that erases saved content, including created wrestlers, championship story modes, and game saves.[1] The bug was corrected in later production runs.


Reception

No Mercy received generally positive reviews, receiving scores of 9.0 from IGN,[2], 7.7 from GameSpot [3] and B+ from Game Revolution.[4] Overall, the game had an average score of 89% on Metacritic.[5] Common elements critics praised the game for included the improved graphics, large roster, diverse match stipulations, deep Create-a-Wrestler mode, and improved story mode. WWF No Mercy is considered by many to be one of the best wrestling games ever made.

The greatest wrestling game ever created! Tons of game modes, including Cage Match, Road to Wrestlemania, Create a PPV, and more! Create and bet WWF Championship belts with your friends. Over 50 of the top WWF superstars, more than any other WWF game! Thousands of signature moves, taunts, and mannerisms. New Create a Wrestler, with custom moves, costumes, and fighting styles!


Gameplay

WrestleMania 2000 used the engine previously seen in WCW/nWo Revenge. More than 50 WWF wrestlers were included in the game, and, with the exception of existing superstars' move sets, all of them could be edited to the player's liking. Using the same system, the Create-a-Wrestler mode was extensive. The player was able to create a highly detailed wrestler, and there was an extensive library of wrestling moves. Usual WWF modes such as Royal Rumble and King of the Ring modes were included, along with a pay-per-view mode, enabling the player to either recreate or create unique PPVs with TV-style features. Players could also create up to ten belts and then put them on the line.

The story mode placed the player on the long road to WWF glory. Starting out as a rookie, the player would gradually work his way up the ladder and earn opportunities to gain various WWF titles, win various tournaments, be challenged by various wrestlers and ultimately main-event at WrestleMania 2000. Although the story mode was long and extensive in the amount of matches it pitted the player in, there were no branching story lines and if the player lost a match it was recorded as a loss in their win-loss record. In fact, wrestlers were expected to defend each title in Pay-Per-View events. For example, if you held the European Championship, Intercontinental Championship, WWF Tag Team Championship, and the WWF Title, the player would have to fight four fights in one pay-per-view, something that would be unrealistic in real-life. There were often feuds at different parts in the storyline, occasionally with one wrestler calling out another wrestler in the middle of the ring. Also, feuding wrestlers would often interrupt matches, helping the opponent. However, the season continues whether or not you win or lose your matches. If the player progresses through a winning season with a created wrestler and then starts a new season as a new created wrestler, the first character will still be used in season mode.


Trivia

    * Some copies of Wrestlemania 2000 shipped with a special card containing 4 holograms of the in game action, such as a wrestlers entrance or finishing move.

Description

Professor Theo has been kidnapped by the imperial forces of the evil empire. Now his robotic personal assistant, Marina Liteyears, must save the day! Marina will get some help from the troops who have remained loyal to King Aster. With their help, she'll grab, shake and throw her way to the Professor! Besides rescuing the Professor, Marina will also join in the effort to rebel against that nasty, horrible and evil empire. So, Grab a controller and help our Super Heroine shake up the evil empire!


Story

While visiting the planet Clancer, Professor Theo, a self-proclaimed 'genius in robotics', is kidnapped by the Empire, acting upon orders from their evil emperor and estranged twin brother of Theo, who wishes to fill the world with hate and despair. Upon realizing Theo's abduction, his robotic maid Marina Liteyears sets out to rescue him.

She proceeds to travel through over 50 levels on Planet Clancer to find her creator. Every person, animal, and inanimate object on the planet (including the planet itself) has an identical "face", seemingly belonging to a species called 'Clancer'. Along the way Marina attempts to rescue the professor but she is repeatedly impeded by agents of the Empire, whom she must defeat to rescue the professor.

Gameplay

Marina's main way of attacking is her grab move. She is able to take hold of enemies, objects, weapons and even some enemy projectiles or attacks, which can be thrown or shaken, depending on the object. When certain objects are shaken, items such as crystals might appear. When Marina shakes some other objects, a secondary effect may be activated.

Later on in the game, Teran is available to play in two levels. His moves includes a standard punch, upper punch, low kick and a block move. He also has the ability to hang from ceilings. His signature skill is the ability to jump up to three times consecutively.

Hidden within every stage is a gold gem. These gems are used in the final cutscene of the game with every gem adding one to three seconds to the ending. The extended ending adds character development to the villains, among various other things. The way the gold gem appears differs from stage to stage. For example, the gold gem will only appear on some boss stages if the boss is defeated without Marina being hit.

Overview:

The gameplay is similar to Pok¨¦mon in that it shares the same concept of catching monsters. Your character finds a monster and raises it to battle evil. The towns are presented in a top down view. The houses, inns, bars, dungeons and shops are fixed points you can put a cursor over. The battle system features a bar of musical notes that the player uses to command the monsters. You can carry up to four monsters at a time.
