The season mode contains most of the major college tournaments including early-season tournaments, although the National Invitation Tournament was not included.

The game uses Fox Sports's TV set-up in order to give the player a more realistic feel to gameplay. However, there is no commentary and there are no fight songs or other university-specific songs in the game
