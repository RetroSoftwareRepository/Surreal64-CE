Authentic Nintendo 64 effects and newer, fiercer levels pack stunning graphic detail into an already vicious version of Quake II! Featuring Two-, Three-, and Four-player Deathmatch, fully customizable controls and save game features, this masterpiece takes gaming to an undefined level! Eerie environments of light and shadow loom within newly designed, mission-based levels not found in the PC version. Incredible engine speed and fluidity intensify each level to a fast-paced, high-action gameplay experience!

The Nintendo 64 version, unlike the PlayStation version, had completely different levels, music and multiplayer maps. Like the PlayStation version it too featured multiplayer of up to 4 players. This version also had new lighting effects, mostly seen in gunfire, and also used the Expansion Pak for extra graphical detail.
