Critical Reviews

NASCAR 99 received mixed reviews upon its release. The game was praised for its realistic graphics regarding the cars, although critics felt that the other graphics were "lacking". Also, critics stated that the game was "repetitive and boring," mainly because of the 17 tracks included in the game, only 2 are road-courses (Watkins Glen and Sears Point), and the rest are a mix of ovals, tri-ovals, quad ovals, and short tracks.
