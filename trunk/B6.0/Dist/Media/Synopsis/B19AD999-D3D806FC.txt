Overview

It offers improved graphics, an updated interface, new trucks and tracks and the addition of variable weather conditions from its predecessor. However, the game engine is essentially the same as that utilized in the original game. A testament to their similarity is the fact that most custom trucks and tracks are compatible with both games.

The "Summit Rumble" king of the hill tracks could only be played if one intended to compete online.

Again, "Army" Armstrong provides commentary for the game. However, his race calls have been updated, and new ones have been added.

Just like its predecessor, it contains an inaccessible truck, "Chuck's Car" (a Chevrolet Camaro). It was intended to be unlocked by typing in "CHUCK" in a race. The game still displays this message when typed: "Restart the game to drive Chuck's Car." However, if one restarts the game, it isn't there.

The game contains assets from older TRI games, like Hellbender and CART Precision Racing.

When the Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback wheel was launched, the installation cd also contained the game.

Monster Truck Madness 64 is a Nintendo 64 port of Monster Truck Madness 2. It was released in 1999.
