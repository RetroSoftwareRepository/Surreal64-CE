Destruction Derby 64 (DD64) is the Nintendo 64 version of the PlayStation game series Destruction Derby,which is based on the real-life sport of demolition derby, with some differences.

Graphically and technically, the game was considered by some people[who?] as better than its PlayStation counterpart, with more cars available, brighter and better graphics and better recreation of crash damage, which included the hoods and trunks of cars flying off in hard collisions.

The cars that the player starts out with are rather basic generic saloons which have been painted up for racing and smashing. As the player progresses through the various championships they are awarded certain bonus vehicles, such as a black Hot Rod with flames and a blue Ford Mustang GT hybrid called the 'Blue Demon'.

The tracks are varied, from the traditional demolition derby arenas to the circuit races such as 'Destruction Junction' and are reasonably detailed in comparison with the PlayStation version, although the texture detail suffers due to the Nintendo 64's smaller texture memory.

Multiplayer has split screen for up to four players. The arenas that can't be played in single-player 'arcade' mode are available in multiplayer once they are unlocked in the championships.

Cars

There are 24 cars in all. The player starts out with 12, but as well as the cars that are gradually unlocked there are 12 secret cars that you earn by doing championship mode and time trials. The cars in the game are left generic and have no manufacturer branding; possibly due to missing licensing agreements with the automobile manufacturers. These cars include:

Baja Buggy: A blue and yellow car, which looks like a Volkswagen Beetle.
Low Rider: Purple low rider with blue hood design, which looks very much like a 1967 Chevy Impala.
Woody Wagon: Green wagon with wood panels.
Pickup: Cloud and gold color. Looks like a Chevrolet S-10.
Taxicab: Yellow taxi with checkered pattern.
Blue Demon: Ford Mustang GT. Light blue with a blue stripe through the middle.
Ragtop: Red car with white stripes. Similar to a Corvette.
Hot Rod: Black Hot Rod with flames.
Ambulance: White with red stripes.
Hatchback: Similar to a AMC Gremlin. Green with a dark green stripe.
Street Rocket: Light blue with turquoise front.
Police Car: Grey with white doors.
