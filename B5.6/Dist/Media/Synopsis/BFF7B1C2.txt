Story

Long ago the Devil (A character designed by Akira Toriyama) was sealed away by the powers of the Three Fairy Spirit Stones. These stones created a barrier which he could not pass, then one day he escapes, and continued his war on the Fairy World people. The Princess of the Sky portion of this world was then asked by her father to go to the Human World and return with Doraemon's three-dimensional pocket. She arrives in the Human World to get Doraemon's pocket, but as she does the Evil King comes, in the form of a bat, and steals it. The princess chases the bat back into her world and disappears. Doraemon Nobita and friends decide to follow her and see if they can get back his pocket. When arriving they find that this human looking princess now has the body of a small fairy complete with wings. She tells them that she was changed into this form by the Devil, and that she managed to get Doraemon's pocket back, but in the struggle all his useful items where lost, among the three areas of Fairy World; Earth, Sea and Sky.

Reception

When the game was released, many Nintendo 64 owners complained that the game was a complete Super Mario 64 rip off. On Gamespot, a reviewer said that "the gameplay was extremely tedious and slow". The reviewer also said that "the game was not original, and was like Super Mario 64 put through a strainer until there's nearly no entertainment value left".
