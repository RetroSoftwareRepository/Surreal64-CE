Densha de Go! 64 (?GO!64 Go by Train 64?) is a train driving simulation game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan on July 30, 1999. Densha de Go! is the only game that works the special N64 version, train driving controller which simulates actual train controls, and one of two games that uses Nintendo 64's "Voice Recognition Unit" or as it is known in Japan the VRS. Like Hey You, Pikachu! it was sold with (Engineer's Pak) or without a microphone that was used to announce train stations to passengers, using the Nintendo 64's "Voice Recognition Unit" or as it is known in Japan the VRS. It is part of the Taito Densha de Go! series.

Playability

There are 7 main lines, with 13 vehicles, on 16 missions. The Hokuhoku Line, Akita Shinkansen Line, Ou Main Line, Tazawako Line, Keihin-Tohoku Line, Yamanote Line, and the Tokaido Main Line.

New to N64[3] is a "Beginner Mode" which allows 999 seconds for the player to complete either the Training Course, or Practice Course. The player is given an allotted amount of time to bring their train into the next station as well as a fixed time that the train was expected to arrive. If the player goes around curves to fast, stops suddenly or encores other such dangers of train operation a few seconds is taken way from the remaining time they have to complete their task.

Densha de Go! 64, Controller

As with most Densha de Go! games this version has a special controller this time for the N64 version which needs to be plugged into controller outlet 3, while the voice mic was inserted into controller outlet 4, and a standard controller in outlet 1[4]. It consists of a switch on the left that goes up and down, controlling the trains speed, all five of its drive speeds and Neutral. The handle on the right controls the breaking speeds 1-8, Emergency brake, and doors opening. Between these two levers is a depression that a person could place a pocket watch or stop watch (not included but designed to look more realistic) to keep the time as they drive. There are five buttons, A, B and C, a start and select button, the select button acting as the Z button to show distance to the next stop, in some game variations
