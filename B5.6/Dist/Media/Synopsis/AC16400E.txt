Gameplay

California Speed is similar to games like Cruis'n USA and San Francisco Rush. Players drive through the streets of California with exotic jumps and crazy tracks. You travel the streets with eight different racers on the track trying to take the lead. Sometimes on the road you encounter traffic you must avoid and hills to jump. Players get to choose a lineup of generic cars to race with either the Automatic or Manual transmission. There are fourteen different tracks with three different difficulties from Easy to Hard.
