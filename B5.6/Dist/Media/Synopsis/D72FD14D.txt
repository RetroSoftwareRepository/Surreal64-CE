Gameplay

One of the earliest in Konami's franchise, this version featured 300 actual MLB players at the time, but did not feature the MLB licensed teams. Players can choose to either play against a friend in Exhibition, Season or Playoffs. The gameplay is geared for more of a simulation style of play with the players stats determining on how well they hit, pitch and field. For example, hit a home run with the last ball of the match, or stop a team from scoring in the final inning to complete each scenario. Training and support for 2 player multi-player are also available.

Along with the standard modes for a baseball game, this one also featured the ability to customize their teams and choose any player to create their "Dream Team". It also had a variety of different camera angles to choose from and had meters to show their players progress such as a "Streak Bar" that showed a batters hitting ability and a "Pitching Bar" that showed whether a pitcher was fatigued.

Bottom of the 9th is a baseball game by Konami for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. It is a heavily updated version of Konami's 1989 arcade game Bottom of the Ninth [1]. It was originally released for the Sega Saturn.
