Game Play

The official players in Mike Piazza's Strike Zone have different batting and pitching styles as well as stamina that causes them to perform with less precision after being used continuously. When batting the ball has a flame-like trail behind it that tells the hitter whether it is in the Strike Zone (red) or in the Ball Zone (blue), allowing the player to better choose which balls to hit. Saving the season, and saving a player created team, require separate Control Paks. While playing with a Rumble Pak it cannot be replaced with the control Pak while the game is being played, and a separate controller is needed to save

Reception

With a long list of customizable features and early test previews, the game received good previews from gaming Sites such as IGN. When finally released, however, the game was criticized for its graphics, few voice clips, continuous sound elements repeating themselves over and over, simple challenges and unrealistic home run hitting. It was compared to contemporary games such as All-Star Baseball '99 and Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey, Jr., both released for N64 that same year. .The game would generally receive low scores from the gaming media;
