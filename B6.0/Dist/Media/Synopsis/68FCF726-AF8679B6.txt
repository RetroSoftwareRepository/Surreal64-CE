Gameplay

The player can choose from one of the eight fighters in a match or "Duel" after beating the other seven characters and a dental version of themselves, there are two other opponents; Gouriki (a character wearing a cat mask and rope-like fairy wings), and Ohgami Reiji (the final boss that wears a large straw hat covering his eyes, and business suit). Reiji while fighting can change into one of two other creatures characters. Hikari an all white humanoid with a third eye in his forehead, and Yami a grey skinned man with Purple beard and long side burns. The difficulty of the opponents can be changed from very easy up to expert, while the rounds, and how long they last can also be manipulated. There is a Versus mode, for teaming up or one on one, as well as a create your own fighter option. Unlike most 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the player also receives points for how well they do, and the combination of moves they use. While creating their own character, the player can choose which type of body, height and such, then practice with the new player in the training area to gain more moves. The players game progress, scores, and created player can be saved onto Memory Paks, allowing the player to continue to try and improve their stills. There are 12 arenas in all 9 of which are available at the beginning of play and three unlockable ones, the two main boss characters also become playable after unlocking them, with Reiji the two creatures can also be transformed into and used while playing.
