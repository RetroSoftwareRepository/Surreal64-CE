Dance Dance Revolution Disney Dancing Museum was released only in Japan in November 2000 for the Nintendo 64. It was sold as part of a bundle pack that featured the game as well as an exclusive N64 controller designed for this mix that featured popular Disney characters. The game featured 22 (20 that must be unlocked) songs from various Disney franchises and other popular musical numbers. The songs where unlocked by players putting together puzzles of famous Disney characters. It shares three songs with the PlayStation Disney incarnation Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix and several modes of game play including single and dual player, and dance magic (a battle mode). The game also features a unique game play mode where the player both dances on the dance pad and uses the controller to press a single set arrows on the right and left side of the screen using the N64 controller's Z button.
