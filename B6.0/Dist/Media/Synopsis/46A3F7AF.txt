The objective in this game is to outrun nine different cars in twelve different courses while listening to various kinds of music, and doing different kinds of stunts to gain time. Unlike the first two games you can make your own account by typing a PIN.

Exclusive to the Arcade version are real cars (ex. Chevy Corvette, Plymouth Prowler), where the console versions used created cars like the previous games in the series. In the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color version when playing the game for the first time most of the tracks are locked. Along the way you unlock new cars and stages by gaining miles. The Nintendo 64 version can save different accounts while the Game Boy Color version uses the password system. The Nintendo 64 version can allow players to use the rumble pak during the gameplay. Both the Arcade and Nintendo 64 version can allow up to four players on the track.
