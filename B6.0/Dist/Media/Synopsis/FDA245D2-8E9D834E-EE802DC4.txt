Plot

Extreme-G is set in the distant future where Earth is a mere wasteland. From their new found planet the human colonists watch with joy as their remote controlled power-bikes wreak havoc through their ancient cities. There is only one winner, the first to cross the line... or the last to survive.

Overview

As with all Extreme-G games, futuristic racing pilots race plasma-powered bikes in an intergalactic Grand Prix at speeds that are over 750 km/h making it the third fastest racing game on the Nintendo 64, only beaten by F-Zero X and Star Wars: Episode I Racer. The emphasis is on speed and creative racetrack design, with tracks looping through like roller coasters.

At the beginning of each round, the player is given three "nitro" powerups which provide a temporary speed boost (these powerups cannot be replenished). Also, falling off cliffs or, in some cases, the track itself results in simply losing time rather than losing 'lives'; bikes are teleported back to the track and must rebuild their speed and lost time from a dead standstill. Some parts of many tracks are shown to be hundreds of feet in the air.

This is the only game in the series where a vehicle is unable to reach Mach Speed but nothing is impossible.

Gameplay

The gameplay of Extreme-G consists mainly of fast-paced racing through an array of futuristic environments. An impressive array of defensive and offensive weapons is available on-track. These include multi-homing/reverse missiles, magnetic/laser mines, and shield-boosting power-ups. Special weapons can also be found such as invisibility, phosphorus flash and the mighty Wally-Warp which if not avoided, can instantly transport a bike right to the back of the pack.

Vehicles

Each of the machines has their own strengths and weaknesses. These are decided by the following 5 characteristics:

Accel (acceleration)
Speed (maximum velocity)
Turns (handling)
Shield (electronic armor battery life)
Weap (primary weapons battery life)

Another variable between the bikes is the type of primary weapon the bike has installed. There are three types Pulse, Laser and Excel; again each having its own strengths and weaknesses. With the characteristics varying considerably between vehicles, some will be better than others at reaching specific goals.
