Series

The series had its origins with the NES platform, late in 1991 with Konami Hyper Soccer, Konami's first soccer game on consoles. Although technically not a game in the series, the success of the game was enough for Konami start developing Jikkyo World Soccer: Perfect Eleven for the Japanese Super NES, released as International Superstar Soccer for the rest of the world, both in 1994. An improved version, Jikkyo World Soccer 2: Fighting Eleven (worldwide, International Superstar Soccer Deluxe) was released one year later, and saw a Mega Drive / Genesis version in 1996. These 16-bit titles, in many terms, were one step ahead from other contemporary football games, including FIFA International Soccer:

Instead of tiny, super deformed players on pitch, player sprites had an adult look to them;
The players looked all alike, only changing hair and skin color from team to team. ISS players had distinctive looks, corresponding to real-life players of the time: the Swedish forward Magnus, is Martin Dahlin, the Argentine Fuerte is Claudio Caniggia while Capitale is Gabriel Batistuta, the Italian Galfano is Roberto Baggio while Carboni is Ravanelli;[citation needed][original research?]
This was the first football game to ever show back numbers on the jersey for each player (though the keeper's jersey always showed a number 1, independent of his assigned number);[citation needed]
The adult look given to players made their animation quite real, instead of the rather cartoonish way shown before (like the players jumping in slow-motion in FIFA IS), thus turning playability more fluid[citation needed];
The game was the first to feature play-by-play commentary (more frequent in the Japanese versions);[citation needed] previously, the announcer's voice could only be heard shouting "goal", and it was not present in every game.[citation needed]

In 1995, the first KCET title, Winning Eleven was developed for the PlayStation (Goal Storm internationally) and in 1996, Jikkyo J-League: Perfect Striker made its debut on the Nintendo 64 (re-used worldwide in 1997 as International Superstar Soccer 64 with international teams instead of J-League). In 1997 and 1998 there were several titles released, including the second and third versions of Winning Eleven (which included a fully-licensed release for the 1998 World Cup), but the first major in Europe since ISS Deluxe was International Superstar Soccer 98 for the Nintendo 64. It was one of the best titles for the console[citation needed], and one of the highest selling third party titles.[citation needed]

By the turn of the century, KCET's Winning Eleven titles were improving considerably over KCEO's titles[citation needed], and in 2000 ISS Pro Evolution was released worldwide. The last title for the Nintendo 64 was International Superstar Soccer 2000, based on Jikkyo J-League: Perfect Striker 2, and when ISS Pro Evolution 2 was released in 2001 and followed by the first Pro Evolution Soccer, there wasn't much room for the Jikkyou World Soccer/International Superstar Soccer series, although three ISS titles were released, the last (ISS 3, in 2003) for the first time was released for personal computers. There were also three Game Boy Advance versions, one of them based on ISS Deluxe.
