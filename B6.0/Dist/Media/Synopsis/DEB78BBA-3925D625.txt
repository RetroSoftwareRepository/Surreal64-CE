_________________________

The game was the first to feature the concept of covering the ball while running and the chop block and "clothesline" techniques which were later scrapped and moved to players simply tackling ball-carriers. The game also had twelve historic teams including the 1978 Steelers and 1985 Bears and secret teams such as the Tiburon sports team and NFL All-Star teams from each decade.
This was the first Madden game to feature Franchise Mode, in which the user could control their team for 15 seasons. The user was able to trade players, sign/release players, draft future players, etc.

Glitches and errors

Offensive Players progressively get better in attributes, while defensive players rise slowly.
There is an abundance of 90+ rated kickers and punters in the NFL Draft in Franchise Mode and less players rated at any other position and draft talent differs from year to year.
The NFL Draft in Franchise has only 4 rounds as opposed to 7 in real-life and if the player simulates the draft, they will forfeit their remaining picks.
If the player waits too long to throw the player will receive a penalty for holding.
The Nintendo 64 version does not call any penalties except for holding, encroachment, offsides, false start, and delay of game. You may set penalty levels for roughing the passer, roughing the kicker, personal foul, face masking, def pass int., off pass int., fair catch int., punt catch int., clipping, and intentional grounding, but they do not appear to be functional.

Free agents

Created Players from NCAA Football '99 can be put in the game as free agents and put on other teams in Quick Game Mode.
Darnell Autry of Northwestern Wildcats football fame is in the game as a free agent.
Gary Zimmerman appears as a free agent despite being retired at the beginning of the season.
