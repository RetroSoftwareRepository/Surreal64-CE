The Story
The World of Neo-Amerika

In the not-too-distant future, the mighty country known as America has fallen like all great empires throughout history. Its fifty states broken into private territories after what was called... The Techno-Industrial Civil Wars. Computer technology, bio-engineering, cybernetics and mechanics accelerated at such an incredible rate, it forced industrial competition to the point of uncontrollable and ruthless corporate espionage.

While the government tried to keep control of the country by a single thread, the effect of the giant corporations' white collar wars drove the economy into a tail spin. With Wall Street in shambles, the government bankrupt and technological corporate giants running unorthodox takeovers, Neo-Amerika was born. Starting with Micro-Gene, a Dallas based microchip / bio engineering company, New Mexico was easily annexed by the construction of more micro-chip processing plants and cloning technology labs. Arizona was the company's next target and by the time Micro-Gene moved in on Nevada, things started to get ugly. Micro-Gene had been using enhanced agents to spy, sabotage and gather information on competing companies, but other competitors began fighting back with their own brand of genetically enhanced corporate spies and agents.

These wars between giant corporations a.k.a. "GI-Corps", gave way to more complicated, advanced and unethical methods. The kidnapping of corporate executives and replacing them with clones capable of downloading company secrets was becoming commonplace. Soon, murder and terrorist tactics became tools of choice in the battle between the GI-Corps.

With the advent of the GI-Corps battles, each State developed desperate measures to secure themselves from a hostile take-over. By declaring Federal independence from the U.S., drastic laws and borders were created between states. Violence soon reared its ugly head and the Techno-Industrial Civil Wars began.

Something had to be done before the once great country destroyed itself or became target to outside invasion. An agreement had to be made between the government and the GI-Corps before America was torn apart. So a radical concept was introduced to prevent the possible loss of millions in the increasing wars between GI-Corp controlled states. Thus...

Overview

The game uses a fully polygonal fighting engine, with 8 different fighters, and 2 boss fighters. It sets itself apart from the majority of fighting games by not locking the players down to a 2D plane of combat, allowing the players to move in full 3D including flying into the air for short periods. This allows you to move to higher levels in the arenas, of which there are 10, though only 9 are selectable in Vs. modes. Some of the arenas also have traps which can damage the characters or even kill them immediately.

Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. uses a mix of hand-to-hand and long range combat. Each character has an assortment of special attacks, both close and long range, as well as 'finishing attacks'. Much like the Fatalities of the Mortal Kombat games these moves can execute your opponents while some, like in Time Killers, will remove limbs. Also damage from powerful attacks can add up causing a limb to be destroyed as well.

Limb Loss can be shut off, however, just as the blood can. You can even configure it to allow limbs to regrow after a while or stay missing for the rest of the battle. Limbs lost during the first round return, either way, at the start of the second.

Gameplay

The fully 3D nature of the game yields a different style of gameplay from the traditional fighting game. Players are able to not only move forward, backward, sidestep, and jump but also to fly away to a safe distance or speed dash in for close combat.

The players could stay close range for a more traditional experience, go long range and volley and dodge shots from each other, or play cat and mouse as one person continually moves across the room and the other speed dashes after them.

The game also has the buttons dedicated to a specific limb instead of level of strength. This makes it a more intuitive control with the four face buttons grafted to the limbs and the shoulder buttons used for dodging, flying, and your basic long range attack.

Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. offers several gameplay modes. The standard Arcade Mode which allows you to battle in a series of one-on-one battles against the other A.I. operated characters of the game, including the two bosses. The also standard Vs Mode where you can battle one-on-one against another person. There is also a Practice Mode so you can learn the controls of the game.

The other two game modes are Team Battle allowing you to play against the computer or another person in anything from two-on-two to five-on-five battles and Survival Mode which cannot actually be won as you fight each character again and again getting as many wins as you can before being defeated yourself.
