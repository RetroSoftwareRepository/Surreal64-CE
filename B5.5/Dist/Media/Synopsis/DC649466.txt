Story

The player character wakes up, and thinks "Oh boy, I'm 10 today, time to become a monster breeder". After getting and hatching their first monster egg, the player begins their journey raising monsters to fight.

Gameplay

The game is a 3D RPG in which the player character walks around the world, collecting requests from people and raising his monsters. The requests are fairly standard RPG fare, such as "collect a tasty cake for Ms. Whoever", as are the Pokemon-style, turn based battles. Less like Pokemon are the monsters themselves. Every monster in the game comes from the one baby that the player receives as their first monster. Depending on the food it is fed, it gains element points, which determine how it evolves. Monsters levels up both through defeating other monsters and when walking around the town. Monsters hatch from eggs that can be bought at the local monster shop.
