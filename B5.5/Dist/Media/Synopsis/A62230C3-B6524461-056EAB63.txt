Story

120 years ago, in preparation for the coming doom, mankind began an exodus to the manmade satellites in outer space. But the "Day of Judgment" arrived even before half the population had escaped to space. The shift in the tectonic plate caused the shape of the Pacific Ocean to change and a new continent was created.

After a 100 years, the only inhabitable area were limited to the area around the new Pacific Ocean and the new continent. New nations were founded on this continent and mankind began rebuilding their lives. In the midst of rebuilding, "Gaiathyst" a mineral which releases an energy similar to gravity was discovered as a new source of endless energy.

The nations began to war with each other for domination, but conventional weapons were found useless due to the influence of the Gaiathyst. To fight under these conditions, the power suits used to mine Gaiathyst were improved for combat. But the "Gaiathyst War" came to an abrupt end by the invading forces of the Zodgierra Empire from outer space.

After conquering the nations, Emperor ZORR creates the "SAP", a super gravity producing device. Orbiting over the new continent, the super gravity of the device, prohibits beings not wearing a power suit to exist under it. Protected by the super gravity, ZORR commands his empire from a tower under the SAP.

A few brave make a stand to defeat ZORR. They are the true Heroes!

Version Difference

There's not much differences between the Electro Brain Version from the US Region (USA Version) and the Hudson Soft Version from EU Region (European Version) and the JP Region (Japanese Version). The only difference is the Electro Brain Version has 2 bonus characters GEZORR and ZORR which were the bosses in Dual Heroes and were not playable in the normal versions of Dual Heroes. There were also other changes made such as the characters ending story line dialogue text which was changed and also the stage text info changed to fully English text other than the Hudson Soft Version from the EU Region and Australia which both had English text and Japanese text together to translate. In the Japanese version it only had Japanese text on the stage info including other stuff like the main menu etc. and also the VR Characters voices were dubbed into Japanese. Also the Hudson Soft Version from the JP Region, EU Region and Australia have the same box cover art and the Electro Brain Version from the US Region is the only one to have a different box cover art. Not many people knew about the differences between the Electro Brain Version and the Hudson Soft Version.

Beta Versions

There were also some unseen pictures of the beta version and there were also two beta versions of it, the HUD (Head-Up display) in the game went through some changes in the development, there was at least 3 different styles of energy bars, the borders were different and there were some portraits for the characters on the sides of the screen and the one in the Nintendo 64 is the Final Version.
