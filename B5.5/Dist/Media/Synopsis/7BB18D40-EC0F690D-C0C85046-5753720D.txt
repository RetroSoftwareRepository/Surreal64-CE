Description

The Professor has asked you to capture the Wild Pokemon of Pokemon island...on film! Tour the island in your ZERO-ONE vehicle and snap pictures of Pokemon in their natural habitat. Wild Pokemon are often camera-shy, so you'll have to use special items to bring them out in the open. Only the best shots will do for the Professor's Pokemon Report, so sharpen your photography skills and get ready to SNAP!

Todd Snap (?, Tooru?), a Pokemon photographer, is summoned by Professor Oak to an unusual island to help him with a report. Oak needs quality pictures to accompany his scientific findings, and knows from past experience that Todd is the right person for the job. Pokemon Island, which contains a variety of climatic and geographic regions, is a place where Pokemon live relatively undisturbed by humans. Using a motorized, amphibious buggy named the Zero-One, Todd explores the island and takes photographs of the wide variety of Pokemon that inhabit its environments.

From Professor Oak's research hub, the player can select between the game's levels and features using a menu system. The path through the levels is linear, similar to a rail shooter. Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit to a course. After completing a course, the player selects their best picture of each Pokemon to be rated by Professor Oak and added to the Pokemon Report. Scoring takes into account various aspects of the pictures, such as the Pokemon's size, its pose, and keeping the Pokemon in frame. Extra points are awarded for capturing a "special" pose or Pokemon, such as a surfing Pikachu, and if there are multiples of the same Pokemon within the frame. Scoring well in the Pokemon Report and photographing a wide variety of Pokemon is required to make progress in the game.

The game features seven levels: Beach, Tunnel, Volcano, River, Cave, Valley, and the special course "Rainbow Cloud." However, the staggered acquisition of items from Professor Oak ensures that the player must re-explore the courses to discover new material. Levels must be replayed in order to locate hidden Pokemon, alternate routes, or photographic opportunities that yield the best scores. It also features a number of special items used to obtain better photographs. Players start out with an apple projectile; this is thrown to either stun Pokemon or attract Pokemon. As they progress, they obtain new items. Next, they gain an item called "Pester Balls", which are able to knock out Pokemon or flush them out of hiding. The Poke-Flute item is used for a variety of ways, such as awakening, irritating, or hatching Pokemon. It can cause Pokemon to dance, and it can play three different songs, resulting in different dances from certain Pokemon. The final item obtained is the Dash Engine, allowing players to go faster than normal. The game also features an "Album mark" where players can mark their favorite pictures to view at a later date or show to friends.
